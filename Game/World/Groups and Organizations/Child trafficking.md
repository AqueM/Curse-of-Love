We met one guy on a wagon with 4 children in it, at the edge of [[Trollbark Forest]]. The wagon smelled of [[rose smell|roses and meat]] to Orpheus, which is the same smell as when he found his [[Zofia Silverlight|wife]]. 

The trafficked children were ranging 6 to 12, from [[Spring Vale]], who seem to be put to sleep with powerful [[carved spell sigil|spell]], bypassing even natural resistances. 


Presumably there are more people like this, as both [[Trollbark wood elves]] and [[Hadrian Deepwater]] said there have been convoys going into the [[Trollbark necromantic barrier]] before.

Servius also said that he learned of this (and decided to stop it/help the victims) by reading an order left by his father. 

Given the guy wore an [[iron mask]], it may be safe to assume that he was part of [[Deepwater Employees]]. 

# Known victims
