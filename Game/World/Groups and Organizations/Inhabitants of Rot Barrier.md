People who moved into the ruins within [[Trollbark necromantic barrier]] a few months before Uktar 1CY, according to [[Trollbark wood elves]]. Presumably the cause of the [[Trollbark Rot]] spreading since.
Probably also involved or causing [[Spring Vale slave trade]]
Have a way to pass the barrier unharmed.
