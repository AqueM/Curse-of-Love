A group [[elf|elves]] who live in [[Trollbark Forest]].
Told us about the [[Inhabitants of Rot Barrier]], to not touch the [[Trollbark necromantic barrier]] itself as touching it makes you start slowly rot into a zombie, too.

Lucan us they wanted to investigate the [[Trafficking Convoys]] but they eventually didn't, and Lucan wouldn't tell us why, as it's a very tight secret for some reason.
