We met them as one guy on a wagon with 4 children in it, at the edge of [[Trollbark Forest]]. The wagon smelled of [[Rose smell|roses and meat]] to Orpheus, which is the same smell as when he found his [[Zofia Silverlight|wife]]. 

The trafficked children were ranging 6 to 12, from [[Spring Vale]], who seem to be put to sleep with powerful [[Carved spell sigil|spell]], bypassing even natural resistances. 


Presumably there are more people like this, as both [[Trollbark wood elves]] and [[Servius]] said there have been convoys going into the [[Trollbark necromantic barrier]] before.

Servius also said that he learned of this (and decided to stop it/help the victims) by reading an order left by his father, [[Julius]], suggesting he is the one that organizes this. 

# Known victims
- 4 [[Spring Vale]] children (alive, magically asleep, ages ranging 6 to 12)

# Hallmarks, heraldry, uniforms
- [[iron mask]]s?
