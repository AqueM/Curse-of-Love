Spreading in a **spiral** fashion from the [[Trollbark necromantic barrier]] in the middle of [[Trollbark Forest]].
It reeks of [[Necromancy]] but doesn't seem to be dangerous to interact with on it's own. BUT it seems to infect the soil and corrupt the plants, causing damage to [[dryad]]s (as said by the naiad from [[Winding Way]]) and [[food shortages]] (as said by the [[Barkhill Village]] elder).

In [[Secomber]], some pigs have eaten rot-contaminated grain and turned "unpleasant to deal with and hard to kill" (zombies?). They became "indiscriminately hungry" (eating each other, people, passing animals...), and wouldn't settled down until they were "sliced into pieces and burned down". 
The local Selunites also had one person who ate contaminated pork and suffered similar symptoms. They hadn't found any cure yet, but are hard at work, hoping for Selune's help.
