The main bridge to [[Spring Vale]] on [[Winding Way]] has been sabotaged by someone with [[non-magical explosives]] recently, leaving the troll under it, [[Stone]] homeless and jobless. 

Spring Vale residents know about this and worry that the lack of working bridge will impact the trade and economy, leaving people jobless, possibly also making [[food shortages]] worse?
