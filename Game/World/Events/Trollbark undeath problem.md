Dead things just don't stay dead in [[Trollbark Forest]]
According to [[Trollbark wood elves]], it started a couple months prior when some new inhabitants moved into the ruins in the heart of the forest. They themselves can't approach the ruins themselves, though, as "something is stopping them".

Since then, [[Necromancy|necromantic]] rot has been spreading out in a spiral pattern out from the ruins, and corrupting the forest. 

We learn that there's a barrier around the ruins in the center, and that touching it makes you start slowly rot into a zombie, too (as informed by the [[Trollbark wood elves]]). They also tell us that they've seen caravans go into the ruins without problem, so there must be a way.

We stopped one of these convoys with the help of [[Servius|bardsassin]] boy and recovered three children from the wagon. The driver called the boy a traitor, suggesting he used to belong to the same group, the one responsible for this event/problem. The boy also said that going into the ruins/barrier is a suicide, probably not because of the barrier but because of what's inside?
