Dead things just don't stay dead in [[Trollbark Forest]]
According to [[Trollbark wood elves]], it started a couple months prior when some new inhabitants moved into the ruins in the heart of the forest. They themselves can't approach the ruins themselves, though, as "something is stopping them".

Since then, [[Necromancy|necromantic]] rot has been spreading out in a spiral pattern out from the ruins, and corrupting the forest.
