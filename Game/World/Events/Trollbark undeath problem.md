Dead things just don't stay dead in [[Trollbark Forest]]
According to [[Trollbark wood elves]], it started a couple months prior when some new inhabitants moved into the ruins in the heart of the forest. They themselves can't approach the ruins themselves, though, as "something is stopping them".

Since then, [[Necromancy|necromantic]] rot has been spreading out in a spiral pattern out from the ruins, and corrupting the forest. 

We learn that there's a barrier around the ruins in the center, and that touching it makes you start slowly rot into a zombie, too (as informed by the [[Trollbark wood elves]]). They also tell us that they've seen caravans go into the ruins without problem, so there must be a way.
On our side, both [[Rowan]] and [[Orpheus]] had touched the barrier and now feel a "coldness" inside.

We stopped one of these convoys with the help of [[Servius|bardsassin]] boy and recovered three children from the wagon. The driver called the boy a traitor, suggesting he used to belong to the same group, the one responsible for this event/problem. The boy also said that going into the ruins/barrier is a suicide, probably not because of the barrier but because of what's inside?

Servius does not know what is inside or what is happening. But he knows that his [[Julius|father]] is connected to it. 

From the people in Barkhill Village and from a naiad in the Winding Water we learn that the rot in the forest is spreading through the soil, too, infecting the dryads of the forest and the crops of the village. This is causing [[Barkhill Village]] to suffer food shortages, and probably everyone else in the vicinity, too, marking it as a realm-wide problem.
