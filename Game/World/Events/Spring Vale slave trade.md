[[The Accountant]] is organizing people trafficking out of [[Spring Vale]] for unknown reasons. It is perhaps also fueling the convoys bringing people into the barrier in the center of [[Trollbark Forest]], related to [[Trollbark undeath problem]]. 
These victims seem to be put to sleep with powerful [[Enchantment]] magic, bypassing even natural resistances.
