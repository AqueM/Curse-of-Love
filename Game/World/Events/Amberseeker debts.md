[[Amberseeker Estate]] is in great debt. Worth 325 000 gp, accumulated partially via gambling in [[The Pit]] by Solomon.

[[Lavinia Amberseeker]]'s solution: marry [[Gwynnestri|Gwyn]] off to a wealthy merchant family.

[[Solomon Amberseeker]]'s solution: take a deal with [[Tyrias Leery]] to cover the debts, and sign off [[Rowan]] to work for [[Julius Deepwater]] until the loan is paid off or until a _deadline_. 
When Rowan argues she would not be willing to work for them, Leery says "it would not be a problem to us" - Rowan figures out that he seems like either way he gets what he wants, if she works off or if the loan hits the "deadline". 

Rowan has the contract (a copy of it?) for this deal on her and showed it to [[Aloysius Goldsworn Le'Tyr]], who interpreted it as such:
if her father fails to repay his loans in time, your entire family, their estate, and titles will all be forfeit to Deepwater.

To solve this problem permanently, according to Nana, one would have to destroy the contract (original? magical source?) kept in [[House of Mirth]].
