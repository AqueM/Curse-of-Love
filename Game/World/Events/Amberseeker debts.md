[[Amberseeker Estate]] is in great debt.
[[Lavinia Amberseeker]]'s solution: marry [[Gwynnestri|Gwyn]] off to a wealthy merchant family.

[[Solomon Amberseeker]]'s solution: take a deal with [[Tyrias Leery]] to cover the debts, and sign off [[Rowan]] to work for [[Deepwater Orphanage]] until the loan is paid off or until a _deadline_. 
When Rowan argues she would not be willing to work for them, Leery says "it would not be a problem to us" - Rowan figures out that he seems like either way he gets what he wants, if she works of if the loan hits the "deadline". 

Rowan has the contract on her but can't properly understand the jargon.
