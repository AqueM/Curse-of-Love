Spreading in a **spiral** fashion from the [[Trollbark necromantic barrier]] in the middle of [[Trollbark Forest]].
It reeks of [[Necromancy]] but doesn't seem to be dangerous to interact with on it's own. BUT it seems to infect the soil and corrupt the plants, causing damage to [[dryad]]s (as said by the naiad from [[Winding Way]]) and [[food shortages]] (as said by the [[Barkhill Village]] elder).
