In possession of [[Misery|Barbie]]. 
Taken from [[Macwood]] study. Written in code. 

Barbie could only make out [[Daggerford]] in the text.
[[Servius]] said he knows the code and that the note indeed says that her [[Delight|brother]] was [[Spring Vale slave trade|sold as a slave]]. He said the handwriting of this note belongs to [[The Accountant]]. He would not say anything more, claiming that "secrets are secrets for a reason" and he can't "share with an outsider" because it would be very dangerous to know this.
