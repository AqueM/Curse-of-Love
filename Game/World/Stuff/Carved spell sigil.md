Found on the collarbones of the children with [[Trafficking Convoys]].

Arcane sigil carved directly into the skin, containing a [[Enchantment]] Sleep spell and somehow making it permanent, and bypass racial immunities (like elves' immunity to being magically put to sleep).

Probably used on all/most victims of [[Spring Vale slave trade]].

Couldn't be undone by [[Oriana]].

Can be dispelled with Dispel Magic with a good enough roll (15+, 20 passes). When done so, it has the same sickly green glow as healed undead things affected by [[Trollbark Rot]].
The carved sigil, once dispelled, can be healed. 

Caused a hunt from [[Wolf]].
