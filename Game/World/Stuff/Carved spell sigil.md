Found on the collarbones of the children with [[Trafficking Convoys]].

Arcane sigil carved directly into the skin, containing a [[Enchantment]] Sleep spell and somehow making it permanent, and bypass racial immunities (like elves' immunity to being magically put to sleep).

Probably used on all/most victims of [[Spring Vale slave trade]].

Caused a hunt from [[Wolf]].
