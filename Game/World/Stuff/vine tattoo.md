The curse put on [[Hadrian Deepwater]] that keeps him from speaking specific secrets or (probably) disobeying [[Julius Deepwater]]'s orders.
Detect Magic recognizes it as [[Enchantment]]

When it was being removed, part of it melted into black ink, revealing a different magic under it. In this ink, Soft saw a [[carved spell sigil|purple-skinned, white-haired person]] who said "I see you" at us. This was most probably the person who cast the curse.
Shar liked that guy.

This curse mark is related to [[Trollbark necromantic barrier]], as it feels similar to the effects it has on the victims.
