A boon from [[Nana]] received by [[Rowan]]. Supposedly opens [[House of Mirth]].

It's [[Transmutation]] magic, and when examined, briefly feels like something - someone? - is looking back at Rowan from the skull's eyeholes, like it has a little bit of sentience. 

Rowan insights that it has the potential to be very helpful or very harmful, but she doesn't know how to make it one or the other. It seems like a decision of that spark of sentience?
