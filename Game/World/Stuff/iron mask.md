Mark of [[Deepwater Employees]] on official business?

The one worn by the convoy of [[child trafficking]] we killed, yoinked by Misery
We also saw people in them trail Hadrian, and Delight wore one while performing an execution at The Pit. 

Confiscated by Selunites at the gate of [[Secomber]] after it revealed itself as related to [[The Rot]] via their screening ritual. 
We figure out that since it was related, it's probably the key that let the convoy inside the [[Trollbark necromantic barrier]].
