Big, well-maintained, conscience-laundering operation. Surrounded with fortified walls, more impressive than surrounding noble mansions.  It also looks too nice, too perfect, the kids too happy etc. 
Run by [[Deepwater Employees]] or at least [[Hells' Bells]].
This is where [[Servius]] was taken as "home".
