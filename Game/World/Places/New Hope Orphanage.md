In [[Spring Vale]].
Houses about 9 tiefling children, including one pink girl.

Previously visited by a pink tiefling boy who asked the pink girl to gift a [[flame-shaped hairclip]] if she meets another pink tiefling. It turned out to be [[Delirium]].

Owned by [[V]], employs 3 caretakers. [[Julius Deepwater]] visited recently, talking friendly with V. Briefly hired [[Misery]]. She got paid 6 silver for one day's work, which is A LOT.

Later Julius said he opened a school for tieflings, which probably means he's going to teach these orphans Evil like the kids in his own orphanag - see [[Deepwater School]]
