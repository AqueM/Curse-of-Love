In [[Spring Vale]]. Houses plenty weirdos, including [[Oriana]] and a blind seer. 

Currently has a pool of black oil-slick holy water where Oriana's tent was, after we leveled it while removing Hadrian's curse and cleansed ourselves from the magical tracking marks with the help of Shar and Eldath.
