A magical barrier in the shape of a sphere extending around the ruins in the middle of [[Trollbark Forest]]. It is [[Necromancy|necromantic]] in nature.
It is see-through but there's nothing unusual that can be seen from outside, just the ruins and the rot.
Touching it inflicts extensive damage (kills?) and causes one to become undead, or at least "slowly rot and then become a zombie" according to [[Trollbark wood elves]]. On our side, both Rowan and Orpheus had touched the barrier and now feel a "coldness" inside.

Animals wandering through it is probably what causes all the undead animals in the forest? But it may also be that they are simply exposed to [[Trollbark Rot]] for extended periods of time. Unclear if the barrier is the source of the rot, or if the source is inside. 

We assume that there is something or someone inside: [[Inhabitants of Rot Barrier]]

# Known victims
- [[Orpheus]] (alive - undead?)
- [[Rowan]] (alive - undead?)
- [[Barkhill Village]] elf scout (undead-dead)
