A maze of connections underneath [[Spring Vale]].
Include tunnels into the Underdark. These tunnels should've been, according to history, destroyed after Spring Vale's war with the drow. When we approached them, they didn't look re-opened, but actively used. 

In the Underdark, there's a magical elevator that can be activated with Deepwater blood (probably relation to [[Nana]] and [[Dr. Solenn Deepwater]] rather than Julius) and lead to [[Nana's Bubble]].
