A place within the sewers of [[Spring Vale]] where **Pit Day** is held weekly.
Gladiator/cage fights of people looking for quick money, and people who [[Julius Deepwater]] just wants to see fighting. 
There is betting going for people who enjoy gambling.
Organized by [[Deepwater Employees]], or at least associates.

[[Julius Deepwater]] is the Master of the Pit. [[Feather]] runs the bets for low-class citizens.

Above the Pit, there is a sanitized section for nobles and rich people. From there, there is no good view of the arena below, and the gallery where the criminals and crooks gather, the corpses etc. is completely obscured via magic. Nobles/recurring guests (like [[Solomon Amberseeker]]) have their dedicated boxes.
