A city along the [[Delimbyr River]], north of [[Trollbark Forest]].

They have a prominent Selune temple, which only grew in influence after they had to set up precautions against [[The Rot]]. Even the guard is wearing Selune insignia - which is weird because in the past Secomber was not a very religious place.
