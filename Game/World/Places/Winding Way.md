A river flowing through the Trollclaws and reaching the sea near [[Spring Vale]]. There's a naiad living in it that talks to local dryads and knows about the [[Trollbark undeath problem|the Rot]]. She also told us that it's relatively common for people to throw in corpses or tied-up people in the river.
