Offered a loan to Amberseekers. Probably a shark loan. Mentioned having a boss, later named as "Lord Deepwater" by Lord Amberseeker. Connecting the dots, we figure out it's [[Julius Deepwater]].

Tall red tiefling. Has a cane and well-taken-care-off clothes. Holds himself like a noble despite not being one. 

Lady Amberseeker thinks he's a criminal. 

His office at [[Deepwater Orphanage]] says he's an [[The Accountant|accountant]].
