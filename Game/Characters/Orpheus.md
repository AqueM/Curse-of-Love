Extreme asshole. Intimidating and rude. Acts like he's hot shit but he's not that strong. Hunter of some kind? Seeks out peace and quiet.
Triggered by being called "husband". Paladin of [[Shar]].

Introduces himself as a bounty hunter. Says he has business in Spring Vale.

# Looks
Freakishly tall. Very pale, white hair, silver eyes. Wears a suit of armor that looks pristine and new; he claims it's because it's a new investment. He looks perpetually sad.
