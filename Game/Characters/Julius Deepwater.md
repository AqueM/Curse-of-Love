Lord Julius of Spring Vale, patron of an orphanage in [[Spring Vale]], father of [[Hadrian Deepwater]]. Not a noble, but called "lord" because he's a war hero (fought Drow slavers ~300 years ago).

Very well-liked, respected, charming. Gets plenty of donations for his [[Deepwater Orphanage]].

According to Aloysius Goldsworn Le'Tyr, he is "a loan shark and a slaver", owns many gambling rings and dens of iniquity.
