Lord Julius of Spring Vale, patron of an orphanage in [[Spring Vale]], father of [[Servius]]. Not a noble, but called "lord" because he's a war hero (fought slave traders according to Lady Amberseeker - did he fight them, or did he take them over? [[Spring Vale Slave Traders]]). 

Very well-liked, respected, charming. Gets plenty of donations for his [[Deepwater Orphanage]].
