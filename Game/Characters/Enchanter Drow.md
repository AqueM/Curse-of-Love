The person who made [[carved spell sigil]] and who put the [[vine tattoo]] on Hadrian.
Presumably one of [[Deepwater Employees]] or at least otherwise employed by [[Julius Deepwater]]

Target of a hunt from [[Wolf]]. Was requested as "handle this first" and "make it slow. Make it hurt." 

Also probably responsible for the ink monster that attacked us after dispelling Hadrian's cursed vine tattoo, and the tracking [[Divination]] spell that it spread on us. 

Knows about us after we dispelled Hadrian's curse: Soft got an impression of them looking at Soft, taking him in seeing Rowan, Gwynn, Orpheus and Misery. That little droplet of a mirror shivers and the water retreats. As the ink dries Soft hears three words. "I see you"
