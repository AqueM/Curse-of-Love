Victim of [[Spring Vale slave trade]]. Mentioned in a [[coded note]] pointing to [[Daggerford]].

The pink tiefling that visits [[New Hope Orphanage]] and gave a girl there the [[flame-shaped hairclip]]. Goes by "Del", just like he did in Baldur's Gate.
Comes to the orphanage to have chats with [[V]].
Part of [[Deepwater Employees]]. An asshole, according to Servius. Julius likes him a lot. 

According to Hells' Bells, he only fucks pink tiefling girls, and that it's a horror show when he does.
