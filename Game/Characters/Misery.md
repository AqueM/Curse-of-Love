# Looks
Barbie is a relatively short, pink [[tiefling]], though most of her usual tiefling traits have an unusual twist to them. The pair of horns that protrudes from her hairline and curves towards the back of her head are a little darker at the end and not as chitinous and rough-looking as for most tieflings. Her tail is ended with a tuft of fur like a lion's or a unicorn's, and the tiny protruding fangs that often peek from between her plump lips look a bit like little hearts. Even her ears, long and pointy similarly to an elf's, differ by lacking usual the inner structure of a humanoid's earlobe.
Her hair is long and just as pink as her skin, though darker and more saturated. The only things about her that aren't some shade of pink is the smattering of white freckles on her cheeks, and her piercing blue eyes.

She is wearing plain travel pants and an oversized, knitted sweater, hiding her posture and body shape quite completely, making her look even smaller and more petite than she probably is. The scale mail she now has over her clothes thus feels very out of place, like a costume of a warrior put on a doll. Much like a doll, too, everything about her is well-taken-care-of: skin and hair soft, moisturized, glowing, clothes clean and orderly, makeup precise.

In comparison to humans, she looks young, like she hadn't exactly went through puberty, or not fully at least. She is by no means a child anymore, but she hadn't developed womanly curves just yet and her face is still a bit round, with a perpetual look of girlish naivety - though it all may as well be something she achieved with makeup.
