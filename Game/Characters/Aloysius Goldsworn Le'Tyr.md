Lawyer-Priest of Tyr that wants to uncover and prosecute [[Julius Deepwater]]'s deals.

"I am _this_ close to being able to prove that he is nothing more than a loan shark and a slaver. He hides it well, but through various schemes he owns the gambling rings and dens of iniquity throughout the town. He lets people build up debt there, unaware that they owe _him_ and then sweeps in with a 'friendly' offer to help them pay up their scattered debts thanks to his generosity, at impossibly punishing terms. And when they fail to pay up, he takes _everything_ and looks righteous doing it."
