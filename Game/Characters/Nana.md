Hadrian's grandmother, living in a [[Nana's Bubble|bubble]] in the form of a magical meadow a few weeks away from Spring Vale.
In this bubble, Julius can't enter nor track Hadrian.

She considers men lesser, and likes Hadrian as an exception/because he is her grandchild. Pressures him to sire a daughter.

Offered boons in exchange of various things. The price didn't seem to be things useful to her, but rather things painful for the buyer to give up. Soft insighted that she doesn't make deals that are fair, but deals that are fun. 
# Boons
- Rowan: happiest memory (planning her future with her crush) for an ornate, gemstone-embedded skull that Nana says is "a memory for a future". The skull is a key to House of Mirth, house of [[Tyrias Leery]]. With that, Rowan can enter his home and destroy the contract, which will rid her of the problem. The entrance is located in Leery's office in Spring Vale, but to get the contract and destroy it will not be easy
- Misery: horn for the knowledge on how to enter [[Trollbark necromantic barrier]], by using a knife blessed by Selune (currently on a corpse of a Paladin in a crypt in the High Moor), which can be used to slice a tear in the barrier to go through it, and then will also help disable it from within.
- Misery: horn for the knowledge if Delight is alive (he is, but she refuses to elaborate if he survived the wounds, was resuscitated, or turned into an undead)
