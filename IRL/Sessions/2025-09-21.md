# Events

13th Uktar, autumn

We start in a [[Starting village]] along the Trade Way, north of Trollbark Forest. 

Gwyn and Rowan run into each other in an inn and have a discussion about dragging Gwynn back home. They accidentally reveal [[Squeex]] which draws the attention other patrons, though not other PCs. 
Orpheus notices a commotion just outside the inn, with locals talking about something with distress. He does not give a fuck about it.
Soft realizes the locals are talking about one of the grain silos of the village. He goes to talk to the locals, but they deny anything being amiss, saying it's surely someone's imagination. They are **very** insistent that Soft doesn't press further. 

Barbie is woken up by a bird smacking against the roof, and she takes it downstairs so that someone can look at it. Soft can't tell much about its injuries so he decides to just heal it magically. It doesn't work, the magic turns sickly purple. She presents it to Orpheus next who cuts it's head off to 'end it's suffering', and the head falls to the ground, but starts to roll back towards Barbie. He then wipes his blade on Barbie's shirt and leaves for his room.
Soft puts the crow back together, and with a flash of the purple magic it reanimates, then dies for good. Barbie figures out with the innkeeper that it came from the [[Trollbark Forest]]; she says they sent some people to deal with things in the forest, but they hadn't came back yet.

We all decide to pack and leave, the innkeeper informs the same guy from before about the bird incident, and goes to the grain silo. 
Soon, we hear deafening flapping of wings and the ground starts to rumble. Rowan figures out that something very big and heavy is walking in our direction from the forest, scaring the birds. 
Orpheus senses that some of the birds are corrupted. Rowan and Gwynn figure out it is perhaps a [[troll]] coming. 

The villagers are either hiding, or gathering around the mentioned grain silo, like this is something not entirely unusual. We hide in the inn, and the innkeeper tells us that this has always happened, but way more frequently lately (second time with a few weeks). Orpheus decides he'd rather hide not with us, so he forces his way into someone's house. Everyone but Barbie is looking through windows to see what's going on. 

The troll seems as sickly as the undead bird from earlier. He has open, festering wounds and seems to be going on auto-pilot. The troll accidentally destroys some things on its way, but otherwise just walks through the village without attacking anyone. 
Soft manages to save the chickens that were in a coop the troll stepped on. The owner decides to gift Soft a little chick in gratitude for it. He names it [[Peep]]

Rowan and Gwynn interrogate the innkeeper about the troll problem. She eventually says that all sorts of corrupted things come out of the forest. Gwynn tries to convince her sister to stay and help, if only to delay their return to [[Spring Vale]]. Barbie asks people around the silo why they didn't hide, they say it's cause they had to defend their food stocks. She refers the info about danger to the others who look like they're travelers, and finally notices Squeex. 
They have a little conversation, where Squeex realizes Barbie is faking "calling me cute would make me feel better", and she tells him she's a maid but doesn't know what a union is. Squeex is distressed about it and even more that Gwynn is rich and has servants of her own, and decides to hide.

Barbie convinces Soft to go with the three of them to investigate the forest problem, because it's safer if there's more people and then they all can safely go back on the road (safely). Chief of the village tries to convince Orpheus to go with them, too. He does so by following us some ways away, attempting to - and failing - to stealth.

We follow the trail of trees fallen by the troll, but it seems like other (presumably corrupted) animals have made completely different paths in different directions. At some point, the forest starts to look really sick and rotten. Rowan casts Detect Magic; this rot is not a spell, but it has traces of [[Necromancy]]. 
We continue on, and figure out that the rot is coming out from somewhere deeper in a spiral pattern. Somewhere deep, we find an elf corpse sitting in a bush, following us with its eyes. It stands up when we talk to it. It seems it's the scouting party that the village sent out. 
We decide to attack it before it can attack us. 
***The zombie tries to touch Orpheus and says "husband?" and he freezes, then becomes super angry, crushing it.*** The corpse repeats the word again before it stops moving. 
Barbie stakes it down to the ground with a stick just in case before we leave.

We move along, and Orpheus gets caught in a trap. He's very rude to Barbie. As he is trying to free himself, a couple [[Trollbark wood elves]] ambush us. They point arrows at us, but do start with talking. Rowan explains who we are and what we're doing in the forest. The elves are convinced., and explain they too noticed the undeath problem. ***They point us to the ruins in the center of the forest, which have gotten new inhabitants some time ago, and for a few months now things in the forest just don't stay dead. They can't approach the ruins themselves, though, as "something is stopping them".***
