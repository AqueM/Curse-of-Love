# Events

late Uktar, 1CY

Barbie brings up Orpheus attacking Rowan before, and [[Servius|bardsassin]] suggests we move away from the scene before whoever was waiting for the convoy shows up. He introduces himself as Servius, after his vine tattoo prevents him from saying his real name. Orpheus insists on Servius telling him who sent the convoy, since he MUST know something because he was called "traitor"; he just says his father sent the convoy, but he can't physically say anything more. Rowan recognizes Servius as the son of lord [[Julius]] of [[Spring Vale]].

Eventually we put the unconscious kids on the two horses and walk away from the scene. Rowan introduces herself and Servius is able to confirm that he is from Spring Vale and is Julius' son. He manages to talk around his silence geas and tells us he found orders about the convoy back home and decided to intercept it. He feels there have been previous convoys, but he doesn't know what happened with kids in them, and they hadn't been seen before. 

Once we get to the Trade Way, Servius says he wants to get the kids to safety, probably the closest village, and figure out why the kids are still asleep. Gwynn casts Detect Magic, and finds [[Enchantment]] magic concentrated on the kids' collarbones, a Sleep spell carved into their skin. We debate how to break the spell since we don't have Dispel Magic, and figure out that maybe fucking up the carving would break the spell, but can't agree on how to do it and where and when. We do notice that some of the kids are elves, though, so the magic must be powerful; they are between 6 and 12 years old. 

We decide to make a decision in the next village over, which is [[Barkhill Village]]. If we can't find a way to wake the kids up there, Servius wants to go to Spring Vale. 

Orpheus identifies himself as a "bounty hunter". Nobody except Gwyn believes when he says he helped with the kids out of good will, though. Servius says we don't look experienced, and ponders why we're here and if people around the [[Trollbark Forest]] posted a 'quest' for the problem if people like we are here. 
Rowan shares she heard unsavory rumors about Servius. 

Barbie asks Servius about the orders he read, and asks if he can read the note she has from Macwoods. He **can**, and tells her that her [[Delight|family member]] was sold into slavery, and she may find more than she bargained for in Spring Vale - as he recognizes the handwriting. Gwyn interjects and asks if he's *able* to tell them who wrote it; he says it's not his father, and admits the name he knows is [[The Accountant]]. 

We arrive at Barkhill Village and Servius says he will camp outside, as he doesn't know how to explain the unconscious kids to the people. Rowan casts Augury and gets "good result" at getting the kids to Spring Vale, and she decides to stay with Servius. She wants to get to the bottom of what's happening with [[Trollbark undeath problem]]. She also summons a familiar, an owl she names Kira. 
Gwyn and Barbie (and Soft) go to the village. Barbie reports to the village chief. She gives back the red ribbon from the zombie they fought in the forest, and the chief says she'll tell the elf's husband. We report about the forest problem, and tell them to watch their kids because of the convoys. She says they hope to solve the forest problem soon, because they're having **food problems**. She admits after Gwyn leaves that the rot is in the soil and the grain they harvested was already corrupted. 
We all go to sleep.

Upon waking up, Rowan sees only a glimpse of Servius saying goodbye to a [[Servius' contact|slender figure]] disappearing into the forest.

We leave for Spring Vale, and on the road Servius asks us for introductions, and we FINALLY describe ourselves. 

The kids we travel with are malnourished and bruised. They seem to have been in a fight before they were put to sleep. Servius acts very protectively about them, and he did mention that he recognizes them from Spring Vale. 

On our third day on the road, Gwyn notices a golden glint in the fields off the road. She approaches it. It turns out to be a trail of golden-blonde hair disappearing into the fields. Barbie says it's probably a monster. 
Barbie volunteers to stay back with the kids to protect them when Gwyn suggests they go an investigate. Rowan sends her owl to scout, which reports back that the hair stretches out much father than was feasible to check out. We go on our way and leave the hair in peace.

On our fifth day on the road, when we're about to cross the [[Winding Way]] river, we see the bridge has been demolished. Servius pulls out a map and reports there doesn't seem to be any other bridge nearby, and suggests we could try to find a narrower spot to try to pass. 
Barbie sees that the bridge has been sabotaged with explosives. 
Rowan finds a well-camouflaged, sleeping troll nearby. Which is weird, trolls aren't usually smart enough to operate explosives. 
We decide to try to talk to the troll despite Orpheus' protests. Orpheus takes the kids/horses and hides away, and we wake up the troll. He tells us someone destroyed the bridge and now he has no home and no job. He does not buy any of Barbie's attempts to convince him to help them. Eventually, Rowan comes out steps out and offers to bring the perpetuators to the troll, and he agrees to carry us over the river for 1 silver per person. He introduces himself as [[Stone]]. Eventually we agree to pay 1 gold total, and Rowan pays for us. Sadly, the troll is not able to put Rowan down on the other side (too far, water cold) and throws her instead, hurting her. Barbie goes second and lands very badly. Soft manages to land perfectly. 

Others decide not to let themselves be thrown.

Rowan leads us to Spring Vale to look for an expert in [[Necromancy]] 

Gwyn, Servius and Orpheus find a small, decrepit bridge and attempt to pass by carrying the kids separately from the horses. Gwyn helps carry the smallest child and stays on the other side. When Servius and Orpheus carry kid #3 the bridge crumbles under Orpheus' feet. He lets the kid they're carrying go to save himself, but he fails and they both fall into the water. Servius rescues the kid while Orpheus gets washed downriver. Gwyn attempts to throw them a rope but fails. Eventually, Servius crawls out of the water and helps Gwyn throw the rope, and Orpheus almost manages to catch it. Something also grabs onto his ankle, then thigh. He kicks it away, only for it to grab him by the belt. Then when he continues struggling against it, he gets grabbed by the balls and dragged towards the bank of the river. He can see a feminine form throw him out the river and let go of him. 

Gwyn and Servius see a watery woman who says that even if you're friendly with the forest people, you can't throw thrash into her river. When asked about it, she tells them that it's common that people come around to throw corpses or tied people into the river and she doesn't want it to happen too often (sometimes is okay, it's free food for fish), and especially doesn't want Orpheus who "stinks like death". She also says that [[Trollbark undeath problem|the Rot]] in the forest is damaging the [[dryad]]s of the forest. 

Servius goes back to the bridge to carry the last kid over it, then holds Orpheus at daggerpoint and ask about the "death smell". Orpheus tries to deflect, but Gwyn tells the boy about Orpheus touching the barrier, and Servius immediately concludes that Orpheus is undead based on the forest animals. Gwyn tells him about Rowan also touching the barrier, and he admits the only way to help them he knows of is to kill. 
They argue about what to do with Orpheus and if he's safe to be around. Hearing that Rowan is already in the city, Servius agrees to just regroup and figure things out later.
