# Events
13th Uktar, autumn, 1CY

We continue through the forest, and it starts getting late and dark. We debate whenever we should keep going or turn back, and since Orpheus doesn't even stop, we do decide to press on.

Thanks to Orpheus' keen eye, we don't get lost and manage to find the ruins. They are sprawling, everything in them is rotten and/or dead, and the animals act like they have the chronic wasting disease, not running away from us. 

Gwynn notices a magical barrier around the ruins, one that the [[Trollbark wood elves|elves]] mentioned. Barbie figures out that it's a [[Necromancy]] barrier, and we do not see anything non-rotten going through it. 
Orpheus gets bored as we debate over if we should go through it or not, and approaches it. There's a burst of magic power and he gets thrown back, barely surviving it. Soft heals him back up, but a single black mark remains on him.
He tries to go through the barrier again, and Rowan attempts to stop him. He pushes Rowan through the barrier. She also gets blasted with magic, gets hurt badly, and "something cold settles within her". 
Gwyn is angry about it and tries to push him (not into the barrier). This reveals his holy symbol (black disc with a purple border - Rowan recognizes it as the symbol of Shar). She starts to leave and demands Gwyn to go with her. Everyone else goes along with her, now sort of afraid of Orpheus. 
Orpheus doesn't care and attempts to cross the barrier again, touching it, getting the same result. He heals himself up and loudly declares that "well now we know that touching it once doesn't make it safe".

We head to the wood elves, figuring we don't want to make camp in the forest and knowing we can't make it to the village before nightfall. Orpheus goes towards the village anyway. 
We talk to one of the wood [[Trollbark wood elves|elves]] and he informs us that everyone who touches the barrier starts slowly rotting like everything else around. Rowan lies that she didn't touch it, but tells them about Orpheus. 
Barbie convinces him to let them stay in their village despite them not letting outsiders in usually. Rowan asks his name, and he introduces himself as [[Trollbark wood elves|Lucan]]. Rowan makes sure before bed that we don't tell anyone she lied about touching the barrier. 

Orpheus camps out in the woods, and when he arises, he finds a large meat hook is stabbed in the tree next to him. He notes its existence and that it is very old, even to his elven sensibilities, and carries on. He informs the village elder about the rot and that they're fucked, and that they need someone versed in the arcane, probably. He refuses a reward, though, then joins a caravan of performers on the road as a bouncer; the leader of the group is trying very hard to flirt Orpheus up. 

Lucan flirts with Barbie, but the other elves seem to want to chase us all away. Rowan talks to the village elder, who is only interested in information about the ruins/the rot. She blames the rot on outsiders. 
Squeex and Peep are found unionizing the local chickens. 
Gwyn and Rowan inform us they're going back to the ruins, and we tag along. Barbie invites Lucan because he offered to be a guide before. He brings us to an old, poorly-maintained road. He informs us that convoys come at night, one wagon with one hooded driver. They don't know how they get in, as the entrance is still protected when they investigate. He says that they thought about attacking the convoys, but "circumstances" didn't let them; he's very secretive about this, and Barbie fails to convince him to spill. 

When we plan to ambush a convoy, Lucan says he can't join us, but he would be very grateful if we share any info we gather. He clearly isn't expecting us to come back, though. 
Sadly, the first night no convoy comes. We entertain ourselves with stories, and Gwyn teaches Barbie how to make love to wood elves for Lucan's sake. 
ORPHEUS THOUGH sees a convoy of just that description. The driver doesn't answer him, and Orpheus notices it smells intensely of roses and meat ***(reminds Orpheus of the smell of when he found his wife).*** He steals a horse from the caravan he was with, and follows the convoy, though he can't catch up.  

At some point, since we hide terribly, someone starts sending us notes tied around rocks. They tell us to go away, and we're arguing back. Barbie intuits that this guy is trying to protect us, and Soft persuades him to come down. We argue some more until a convoy approaches. Barbie hides **extremely** poorly, and the [[Servius|bardsassin]] attempts to help her, but fails so badly that he falls on top of her. It's a young man with a scarred face and gold eyes. Barbie tries to hide again, fails again, and the guy decides to stand in front of her instead. He then throws a bomb and stops the wagon.

We are instructed to kill the driver, don't burn the wagon down, and don't look inside of it. 
We whiff *everything* before the driver gets stabbed badly by the guy. The driver looks at him and spits out **"traitor"** at him.
During his turn, the driver attempts to light the wagon on fire. Barbie puts his torch out with a Ray of Frost. Sadly, the next turn, Gwyn misses and lights the wagon, and then the driver also throws a bomb under his feet and half-explodes the wagon while killing himself. 

Out of the wagon, we pull out four "lumps" that turn out to be kids under sleeping spell of some kind. Barbie and the boy put out the fire so it doesn't spread to the forest, successfully thanks to Barbie's knowledge of firefighting techniques.
