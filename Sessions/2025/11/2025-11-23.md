# Events

Rowan tries to recognize other guests in the noble boxes. Since most are in disguise or otherwise protecting their privacy - except apparently Lord Amberseeker - she only can tell [[Lucia Le'Sune]] from the Temple of Sune. 

Meanwhile, Barbie is accused of leaving and not caring by Del. They argue for a moment and she manages to make him stop choking her. Eventually he lets her go and locks himself inside. HB attempts to drag Soft into a random bedroom. Soft refuses and HB accuses him of leading him on and leaves. 
Barbie pours her heart out at the locked door but doesn't get any reaction. She sleeps against the door. 

Gwynn loses her bet because Orpheus loses, and goes back to Oriana for the night. She sees an unconscious and scratched-over  Servius in the back bedroom and assumes he's not breathing and tries to save him by doing mouth-to-mouth. He wakes up and in shock pins her down painfully. He admits it was his first kiss :( He starts scratching himself after a moment, out of stress, dissociating. Gwynn holds his hands to stop the scratching and gets Ori to help put him back to sleep. 

Barbie leaves the flame hairpin and her holy symbol of Torm under the door and leaves for work in the morning. 

Rowan tries to convince her father about how wrong he is before going to bed back home. She fails. 
She talks with her mother in the morning and brew up a plan to perhaps marry Rowan instead of Gwynn to the 'boring guy' to avoid the awful contract. She goes to First Fish to look for Servius, asking the bartender for him. He doesn't know, but Servius' friends sure will! And he points her to the docks, where a green fella named [[Dink]] should know more. 
She loses her coin purse at the docks. She thinks a kid did it, so she follows him. He goes towards Luck's Draw and into a tent. 
It turns out the kid is Gareth, and he leads her right into Ori's tent where Gwynn and Andy are talking. Andy is giving her life advice, and Gwynn decides to help people with her magic, starting with attempting to dispel [[vine tattoo|Servius' curse]], but she fumbles it hard. 
The kids and the elves argue for a while, waking Oriana and Servius in the process.

Barbie meets V and Julius talking at the Orphanage, but quits the job, which makes both Zaraia and the little pink tiefling very sad. She goes to wake up Soft and together they figure out some clues they heard, heading for Luck's Draw to find a "chemist" that's friends with Servius. 

We argue a little about Servius wallowing in self-pity about the murders he committed before. We investigate Servius' vine tattoo and denote it, and every thread of magic on him, is underlaid with Necromancy. After that we try to wake up the kids again. Gwynn fumbles one spell, but succeeds with the other, though she does turn into a sheep after.
Servius and Barbie talk, and Servius is mad that she's not mad about the murder he committed. 
After that Barbie also spills about her Pact and everyone freaks out and starts interrogating her about her morals and motivations. In the end, they tentatively agree to work together to take Julius down, and Barbie tells everyone her name. 

# Campfires
Soft and Misery talk about others being hostile towards her. He tells her he doesn't agree, and indirectly admits he doesn't exactly mind her mooching off him. 

Misery approaches Servius and the others and tries to explain herself, so they can work together against Julius. Eventually, Servius agrees after she promises not to betray them. She then gives him a feather from [[Wolf|her 'Employer']] , which goes in flames the moment he touches it, and makes his vine tattoo glow for a moment. He says he doesn't know what that was, and doesn't elaborate further.
