# Events

By Abyss

Orpheus finished his fight, goes backstage. People are surprised the fight ended up quickly. Gets offered help to heal up but he waves it away. Heals himself up. Asks about Flavia and how often she fights, only when she gets a fancy. She is one of the bosses favorites. Orpheus goes to the bar and drinks some. Takes a look around Perception: 14, sees Barbie Soft and Hells Bells leave together. Doesn't see anything strange, [[Feather]] taking bets and dispensing money with two masked guards behind her.  Leaves the guards behind to talk to [[Prima]] and a piece of paper changes hands.

Goes back to the Inn and sleep. In the morning goes to the temple to commune with his goddess for guidance about his revenge. Religion: 3 gets nothing. No comforting darkness and silence inside him, but something growing and breathing, moving under his skin like maggots, he feels this decay spreading.

Orpheus goes to the camp on the [[Luck's Draw]] to find seer again who talked to him about his wife

Meets Servius on his way there, leaving out of a blue tent. Orpheus nods at him but Servius doesn't see him. He gets his attention, Servius walks over, and Orpheus asks "Do you know what's the deal with that Flavia girl." Servius freezes, and then offers him a list of her problems. Orpheus asks him what Flavia is, where she is from. Servius explains she's an urchin that her father found around 10 years ago. Asks about what Flavia was wearing in the pit, about the black gloves (and smth else?). Armor was commissioned by Julius for her. Doesn't need a lot of maintenance despite the amount of blood it sees.

"Your father doesn't tell you much?" "I wouldn't say that", Servius scratches at his scratches. "I guess I am just good at keeping secrets."

Orpheus asks if he can say his name, but Servius denies.

Servius points out that his "friends" are over there and Orpheus has to pause and think. Reassures Servius that they are "as close as they can be."

Orpheus asks if Servius thinks the Orphanage [[Trollbark necromantic barrier|smells like the forest]]. Servius thinks its just his father that smells like that. Orpheus insults Julius' personal hygiene.

Servius points him in the direction of the party again, Orpheus says he'll meet them and smiles :) as Servius walks away Orpheus keeps going to the seer. It's too early in the morning for the Seer though.

He goes to check out Ori's tent
  

Gwynn turned back (Still in disguise).
  

Rowan hangs around to help Gwynn. Asks about Gwynn's plans, if she wants to go home. Gwynn denies. Rowan reminds her about telling her about their fathers deals and that Gwynn can come home without getting married off. Gwynn isn't sure if she can trust her sister.

Casts dispell magic another time with Rowans help. Charisma: 15

The magic flows into Rowan instead of the kid, Gwynn feels deep cold, pushes against it with the love and tenderness, it breaks the cold as warmth takes over the cold. Rowan who had felt the cold climb from fingertips up before, feels it climbing back down to just the fingertips.

"Maybe I can fix you" Gwynn proposes. Arcana: 2.
  

Soft goes back to the Inn to look for Peep, Investigation: 17, crudely drawn chicken with a pair of dragonfly wings on a little cardboard piece, has an address on it (the millers backyard). In the backyard he sees a homemade coop. Sees a bunch of chicken Insight: 16, trying to pretend their normal chickens, but Soft knows smth is happening. Keeps looking for Peep, goes to knock on the coop. All the chickens turn to stare in union at Soft.

Asks for Peep to come out. Persuasion: 20, Peep comes out. Wears a bright red scarf. Asks Peep to not leave without telling him, and not leave a dummy in his pockets. Peep turns his back to Soft, "Don't take that tone with me, be happy I'm not mad you left." Peep is insulted and goes back into the coop. Soft sighs and sits down. The chicken advance on Soft and pokes her beak into his hand. Tries to pet her. Animal Handling Dis: 12

Dex Save: 8 Poops on Soft.

Soft talks to Squeex (and Peep) about leaving the chick behind and stuff to chase skirts. (Did NOT take Peep with him to the Pit) gets chased out of the backyard and stays close by to wait.

  

Orpheus gets questioned by Rowan about what he's doing here and how he found them. Explains that he's been there before.

Talk about what they did at the Pit.

"Servius told me you where here" "and you were looking for us?" "no Servius just told me you where here."

Rowan has stuff to do and then wants to go home. Research about the curse she's afflicted with. Noticed the necromantic energy on Servius, Rowan knows the section on necromancy in the library has been closed for the past 16 years. Has some idea about why the section might be closed. History: 24 , The [[Lady Deepwater]] died 16 years ago. Heard from her father, some of the research materials disappeared/where stolen. The few that where left behind/found hinted at bad stuff so it was sealed till it could be studied and made safe. The Dean of Necromancy was Julius wife.

Decides to wait for Servius around.

Rowan notices some Gold missing and turns to [[Child trafficking|Gareth]] for the missing pieces, who denies till Rowan threatens him, then he calls it interest. Rowan says he owes her a favor then. (He implies something sexual but she denies it). He scampers away.

  

Orpheus creepily observes the kids, Gareth says "should we start asking you for money, what are you looking at." Calls Orpheus a pervert.

"the  last time i saw you you were unconscious on my horse" "what did you do while i was uncouncious on your horse" "You wish you knew" "yes!" then Orpheus asks why he was unconscious. Because he lost his duel. Was supposed to go into the school, but he was good at stealing and thought he could do more and stole from them. Orpheus calls him an idiot. Gareth denies and says they told him they could teach him to steal for real, but that not all of them were learning that and that they were being taught to fight. That they were supposed to kill each other but he lived and the creepy purple guy in the cellar with the white hair gave him that spell/rune and he fell asleep.

They all try to remember if they know someone like that

Rowan History: 12, rings no bells

Gwynn: 19

Orpheus: 18

Sounds a lot like a description they got of the Drows, Orpheus knows that male Drows aren't often seen, esp on the surface. Springvale fought a war against the drow settlement some 3 centuries ago, which is the war that Julius got his war hero reputation.

Orpheus asks the kid if he sounded anything like this and starts speaking underdark to intimidate him Intimidation: 25, kid turns pale, pisses himself and runs away.

Gwynn and Rowan are NOT happy with this turn of events. Rowan and Gwynn go after the kid and try to calm him down. Gwynn Persuasion: 7 (Nat 1), Rowan Persuasion: 19

Gwynn makes Gareth realize how much bigger and powerful all of them are instead of him. Rowan arrives in time for Gareth to realize she didn't threaten him too much about the stolen money for him to calm down. The sisters reassure the kid that Orpheus has many problems, and offer him to stay outside and away from Orpheus. Admits to having pissed himself and Rowan uses prestidigitation to clean him up. Gives her back her two gold pieces. "We left the others!" runs back inside to get the other kids.

Orpheus checks on the sleeping spell Medicine: 17, kid is very dehydrated. Gareth barges in and tries to get Orpheus to move away and he just tells the kid that the girl would die without any water soon.

Gwynn tells him she's gathering her strength to make her wake up, but doesn't know how to help otherwise. Medicine: 17,

Remembers that Orpheus could heal the girl to  help. (Healing helps with Starvation/dehydration here)

Asks for him to do that he says it was not a spell. Gwynn Insight: 13 / Orpheus Deception: 12, Gwynn knows he's bullshitting here

Rowan tries to find Soft. Investigation: 5 (Nat 1) Does not find Soft, collides straight into Julius. He catches her by the arm to steady her.

"Are you okay? You should watch where you are going." Rowan tries to see if he recognizes her. "Miss Amberseeker right?" Julius met her before when she was younger. Asks if she has any business with her father, Rowan says she's visiting her mom. Says he would want to spend more time with his children. He offers her to escort her home. Rowan agrees. He offers her his arm to take her home.

Rowan asks how his business is going. Julius talks to her about it, about the new tiefling school he opened (and some other bullshit), then asks how Rowan is doing. Rowan complains a little about lacking the practical applications for magic studies. Julius makes a comment about being able to do that during the war and then asks if she chose a focus in her studies. Rowan denies and says many things interest her and he wants to know about what interests her more. She talks about divination and then mentions necromancy. "I wasn't aware the Dean had reopened the department for necromancy." Rowan denies and says it can be dangerous to learn about something when you don't have access to it. (says smth??) Gives her a very charming smile wis save: 25 (Nat 20). Rowan is tempted for a second, but then remembers his face as he took a baby from a mother.

She tries to pretend to be charmed Deception: 13. He slows down his walking, until they're under a tree that still has some leaves, takes a step back to give her some space. "Miss Amberseeker I'm sure you are aware of your current situation, I find your company most agreeable but you need not stretch yourself for me. It is pleasure itself to spend some time in your company. I don't need you to pretend to be anything you are not."

"That's something refreshing to hear, there are a lot of sociality expectations and a lot of people would like to tell me what to do, and that's not something (I would like to do???)", he gives her a compliment for her strength of character and says he wished more people would be like her. then asks if she wants his company any longer. She says she can walk herself home alone but tells him she enjoyed his company.

They're in the diamond distract besides a teashop, she waits to see where he goes, but he walks in the direction of the orphanage that is also in the district so she hangs out in the cafe for a little while. Does not think it's smart to go back to Ori's tent just now.

  

Soft tries to explain to Peep why he was so worried and apologize, Persuasion: 11. Squeex comes out and puts a tiny hand on his shoulder "let it go man, he's not ready." Soft asks Squeex to keep an eye on Peep.

Squeex gives Soft (from Peep) a tiny little needle that has been made from the (hard part of a feather) has been died fully red. "If you have need of him, need of the Peep Squeex!! just break it in half and we'll hear your cry." (also tells Soft to go get laid)

Leaves to give Peep some space.

  

Orpheus heals the kid with the bare minimum +2. His magic looks like thick black liquid coming out of his hands and into the body of the girl. (Put his hand on the girls mouth for extra ew factor)

Gareth is traumatized by what he saw. asks if that is normal. Orpheus offers him some drops from his fingers, Gwynn slaps his hand away, and Gareth says he's not in the habit of licking liquid of strange people. Orpheus says maybe it would have helped him some time in the past. Gareth is disgusted and runs away.

Another kid walks in "Gareth said your magic is fucked" and Orpheus demonstrates it on a scrab of fabric. Kid asks him about learning and Orpheus tells him he's not the one who teaches that stuff. Kid is sus because the school/orphanage ended up with him knocked out. Orpheus is a bit more vague and weird about this. "Find me tonight and maybe I can show you." (Kid is supposed to find him at night to learn about the "ooze")

  

Rowan doesn't see anyone while waiting in the teashop. Tries to think where she could find about necromancy. Arcana: 10

Remembers that [[Andreas]] has some not above board stuff about necromancy at the Feline Sun but also that she is not allowed inside.

Rowan goes in the direction of her house and tries to see if anyone is following her, Perception: 13, feels completely secure. Rowan decides she's save and heads back to Oris place.

  

Soft goes to work.

  

Orpheus has a new recruit, Andy is stuck to him and trying to emulate everything Orpheus is doing. Orpheus goes out to look for the seer, and tells Andy to stay inside. Andy is sleepy and wants to learn/see about the Ooze now. Orpheus goes outside with Andy to show him how to make him the Ooze. Rowan is watching him like a hawk and makes sure that Andy does not leave the tent. Orpheus does not answer where he wants to take Andy to when Rowan asks. Rowan tells Andy to stay with Gareth but he refuses.

Gwynn tries to replicate the Ooze with her magic using. Performance: 16, Andy is impressed. Ask to teach her, Gwynn asks if he can do magic, no. Andy says that Orpheus wanted to take him to a place that he can learn. Gwynn tells him that no school is open at night. Andy points out he learned to steal at night. Gwynn points out that it was bad action. Orpheus tells him that he can take him out another night. Andy calls it magic healing boy Ooze and is upset that he cant learn it now. Says that Orpheus makes it scary and Gwynn makes it fun and he wants to learn to be scary.

Gwynn uses her magic again and this time tries to be scary and growls Intimidation: 21. Andy looks at her with big eyes "okay the girl ooze is scary too", she makes it float over his hands so he can play with the girl ooze.

  

Orpheus finally sets out to visit the Seer.

  

Rowan tries to figure out what Orpheus was going to do with the kid Religion (disadvantage): 7, suspects it was a temple of Shar thing, goes to talk to Gareth about how Orpheus magic is not save and that he needs to keep an eye on Andy, and to tell Servius about it. Reassures Gareth about his fear of Orpheus.

Rowan tells Gwynn about (??the contract ?? her dads plan??) Gwynn hates it because she has to be responsible now. Rowan does not except Gwynn to do anything, just to pay attention. Gwynn says that maybe she can talk to their father. Gwynn thinks about going home and visiting her parents.

  

Orpheus finds the Seer, she does not turn Orpheus way when he enters and does not address him till he greets her.

He asks for an update, if she is still seeing his wife (does not say wife), she asks him who he wishes to commune with. he says you know who "I see many and hear even more, who are you looking for." he's pissed but asks if she can still see his wife (this time says wife) Persuasion: 5 (nat 1) seer turns in his direction "Night has fallen", Orpheus says "So far we agree" she does not say anything else. Is annoyed, and tells her that last time she did not stop talking. "Night has fallen Orpheus Silverlight" "What guidance do you seek"  He says he just wants to know if she can reach his wife.

(says something vague about him using her gifts?) "Orpheus I said Night has fallen." then calls him an idiot for not realizing what she's saying. He is annoyed and leaves.

He wanders around a little bit. Luck (1d20): 20 (nat 20), he bums into [[Feather]]. She looks at him, gives him a fistbump in his shoulder "never seen Flavia finish a fight so fast", then asks what he did to her "I guess I hurt her." Orpheus asks if she fights a lot "nah only if she wants to play, that's why I was surprised that she finished so fast, they're calling you the Flash now." Feather offers him a deal with the bets, asks if he ever thrown a fight before. Orpheus says that he doesn't think he'll do a habit out of this. Feather asks him what he did to piss Flavia off and Orpheus gives her a non-answer ("Pissed a bit to close to each other") Feather takes it a face value. Asks him if they were trying to seduce the same person.

Feather tells him that being mysterious to appear hotter isn't needed because he's already plenty hot. Asks again if he needs to fight but he denies her. Asks then if he needs a girlfriend

Orpheus asks her if Flavia always wears the same thing but Feather tells him that usually she fights in her pajamas and that the armor was special for him. Then tells him she's fucked in the head and one time she ate a guy. Because he pissed off the boss and she had allowance to do whatever and so she just ate the guy. Orhpeus asks her if Flavia looked different. Feather is a bit sus why he's so obsessed with her. Feather tells she is happy to answer his question but wants to spend a night with him first. Orpheus asks her if she's sure and then agrees. Feather drags him into an occupied tent.

Insight: 11 does not know if she likes a soft or rough tough

Intimidation: 16, it does work, she has a very good night. She's a little bruised and banged up, and then tells him "you know if you're that good it's not the pit that you should work in but the brothel", "I'm not sure being after 15 years old is seen as good there." (smth like that)

  

Servius comes back around 11pm, before midnight but late at night. He's clean and wearing brand new clothes that look very expensive, same kind of made as his fathers clothes. Black clothes with black embroidery so it looks shimmery. also wearing some traveling cloth and  has a back with him.

Approaches Gwynn and hands her a pouch of coins and gemstones. "That's for everything you did to wake the children up, I know it's not much but I wanted to give you something anyway." Gwynn asks him where the money is coming from, if it is some of his own money, yes. Gwynn gets 200 gold pieces. Gives some smaller coin pouches to the kids.

Looks at them, notices Soft isn't there, and then asks them if they really think Soft can break his curse.

Rowan Arcana: 24, she thinks remove curse should be doable, in the realm of possibility but not sure if it will work, if Soft can do it.

Servius agrees that Julius was the one that put the curse on him. Servius agrees to trust her.

Then he asks where Orpheus went, Rowan tells him about the events that transpired. Also tells Servius about meeting Julius.

Servius asks if his dad tried to charm her "you went on a date with my dad?" Rowan tells him she did not want to, but might have?? and then tells him about how their fathers have dealings. Servius thinks that he wants Rowans hand in marriage. Rowan does not think that this is what is going on that he just wants her compliance. (Gwynn jokes that he should call Rowan mommy)

Rowan talks about the curse in the forest and the suspected relation to his father and if he knows more about it. Servius tells her he can't say much until his curse is off. Rowan asks if he knows enough to help if the curse is off. Asks how much he knew about his mother.

"Greatest Wizard of her generation." , Rowan "oh no he has a type",  Servius says he's been told his mom was a little eccentric.

Servius is surprised that she wants them to steal from the university. That if he has the curse off of him that he'll have to go underground because he can't hide that he has the curse removed. That he wants to keep helping, but doesn't know how that will work if the curse does get removed.

Servius: "I wanna stay with Gwynn, I mean all of you" talks about the great things they could together, his face turns red as he talks.

Rowan suggests that they could run away with the kids (Gwynn and Servius). Servius tells her that she should not stay her when his father is trying to date her. Rowan tells Gwynn she can't run away because she's cursed. Servius tries to convince her that they don't need to stay in Spring Vale to learn about necromancy that they can go to other libraries.

Rowan tells him that she knows that Julius would not let it go if they ran away. Rowan tells him that someone has to clean up the mess with their family.

  

Orpheus asks Feather if she knows what Flavia is, because there is smth off about her. Feather looks to the right and left then drags him closer and hides her lips with the smoke "Not sure, but I think she's a changeling" "that makes sense, I guess I know why Deepwater wants to keep her close" "Oh I don't think he could keep her any closer." Tells him that rumors are that she's his favorite for many reasons, and Delirium, and Miss but no one has seen Miss a long time now.  Orpheus asks her what the link between the orphanage and the pit is. She tells him it's money, he asks him if that's it. She tells him "He got the same kind of vibe as you do.", Orpheus wants to pretend that she didn't say that, "what you cant appreciate that you're a cold daddy the same way he is?" Blows him a kiss as he leaves, Perception: 15, notices as she learns forward and talking to him really close and calling him daddy, that she was trying to sneak his symbol out of his armor. He grabs her hand firmly "careful where you put your fingers lady."

She's turned on but he's annoyed. Intimidation with Disadvantage: 16, grins and says now she knows what she needs to do if she wants him to punish her again.

  

Next Day Remove Curse

Soft Arcana: 5 + 2 Guidance

Orpheus does NOT HELP

Softs magic finds the the curse mark, with each lap of his magic the ink gets raised a little, some of the vine tattoo melts off and drips off. as the last of the ink rolls off his cheek down his throat and pools into his collarbone. It coalesces into a mirror, Soft sees an impression of deep dark.

Orpheus feels the presence of his goddess shivering inside of his blood. Shivering in pleasure. Something that is close to her gets a mirror into this room.

Soft gets an impression, purple skin, white hair, white eyes looking at Soft, taking him in seeing Rowan, Gwynn, Orpheus and Misery. That little droplet of a mirror shivers and the water retreats. As the ink dries Soft hears three words. "I see you"

The tattoo has been removed no clue about the curse.
