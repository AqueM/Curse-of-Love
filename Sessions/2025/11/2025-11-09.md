# Events

Rowan is 'intercepted' by Soft when she leaves her private talk with Aloysius. He informs her he has an idea how to heal the [[undeath stink]] problem. They go to Eldath's shrine to be out of the way and get more privacy. He explains that he wants to try to cast Gentle Repose to stave off her becoming undead and perhaps maybe heal the issue?
The effect of the experiment is that the divine magic seems to have effect, seems to find response in Rowan, but something is also resisting it. That resistance causes cold to seep into Soft, and the beneficial magic to retreat out of Rowan. In the end, they're unsure if/how much it worked. 
After that, Soft goes back to the inn to finish up his work. Rowan follows him, thinking she may find Gwyn with him. 
She follows him out when Barbie grabs him to heal Servius.
Gwyn tells Rowan about waking up the kids, but instantly tells her that she's not going home. Rowan assures her she doesn't mean to, just is worried about her. Gwyn tells her about her "marriage" with Servius. Rowan is outraged about everything. 

Rowan and Gwyn argue and eventually say that they want to go to the Pit, Servius doubts it's up their speed. We end up just going with him, with Gwyn and Barbie on his arms. Barbie disguises herself as a human girl. 
He leads us to a backdoor in a bar, and to the 'backstage' where gladiators are getting ready. They are surprised by him showing up with girls, and some celebrate/congratulate him. There's also a backstage for performers-bards, where Servius takes us. He begs us to behave, because he will be responsible. Barbie assures him she'll help them not get killed. 
Rowan pulls him aside and questions what he wants with her sister. He admits he's just doing her a favor so she can avoid her forced marriage, while Rowan assumes he wants to drag her into some Deepwater business, but she believes him. 
Barbie sends him off with a kissmark on his cheek to sell that they're his girls.
After that we use the changing room stuff to disguise Rowan as a sex worker. Barbie asks how we could go watch the matches to cheer on our boy, and we make it out to the gallery of the Pit.

Back in First Fish, Soft talks with his boss, who is surprised that Soft isn't trying his luck at the Pit. Hells' Bells arrives and harasses him, saying he's here to "take him to the festivities", then leads him towards the same entrance to the Pit.
Soft notices HB is accompanied by two cloaked people in [[iron mask]]s in the distance. 

At the Pit, Soft sees Servius talking to the booker [[Feather]], and HB nearly sits in his lap. There are commoners and nobles, and performers, in makeup similar to HB, entertaining them. 

As we enter the Pit, Rowan notices that Feather looks agitated, and there are quite a few more iron masked people around who also speak with Servius, then take him away. There are something in the air, and some of the iron masked people look at Rowan and Barbie. 
Rowan tells that to Barbie, and she gets really worried. She explains to Rowan that this means that whoever is running this place _noticed_ us, and Rowan warns Gwyn, too, via a Message cantrip. 

Gwyn approaches Feather to place a bet, realizes she doesn't have any money and tries to bet a ring instead. She intends to bet on whoever she considers best looking. Feather tells her about a new fighter, an elf with white hair, and Gwyn decides to bet on him instead. 
Right as she's about to leave, Feather asks about Servius. Gwyn tells her they're engaged and that the ring she bet with is the engagement ring. Feather is very ??? about it.

HB tells Soft to be good and stay put, and leaves him because he has things to do. He goes straight into the arena. 
He casts a spell (Thaumaturgy) to make the tingling of his jester bells loud, and announces the start of the festivities. He says that courtesy of the Master, there's a new entertainment. 
A platform raises with iron masked pink male tiefling, holding down a man at his knees. 
He invites over the Master, Lord Deepwater, who walks in with Servius at his side. 

Julius gives a speech. He says it wasn't meant to be special but is because they found a _rat_. He says that John, the man held down, decided to "give up all that we're doing here", because his wife got pregnant and he decided to rat them out to Sunnites because he worships Sune. He says that one doesn't get rid of a rat if you only get rid of one, and summons up iron masked people holding the guy's wife and child. 
Julius looks at the three girls and at Soft before looking at Servius, and tells him to _exterminate vermin_. 
The crowd is bloodthirsty, and he buckles under the pressure. He tries to kill John, but his father tells him to start with the woman and child. 
Soft calls out to at least spare the baby, and it buys the support of the crowd. Julius agrees, saying "we're all family here", and takes the baby from the guard. He encourages Servius to continue. He tries to resist, but the vines around his neck tighten and he apologizes quietly and kills the woman. 
Julius then says the honor of offing the man would go to the one who found the rat, and tells the pink tiefling, who he calls [[Delirium]], to kill John.
Delirium slits his throat then pulls out the man's tongue out through the hole he made. Julius pats him on the shoulder with approval, and reminds the crowd that this is what happens to people who want to rat them out, because _they take care of our own_. 

The bodies are dragged to the side, HB announces drinks on the Master as celebration of rat-catching, and then pit fights commence. 
HB talks with Soft and asks him if he's an idiot like those. "He thought his goddess can save him; we don't have gods here, we have the Master". 
Soft insights that HB may not disagree with him about it being too ugly. 

Rowan and Gwyn try to leave, spooked, but the iron masked guards stop them. They say that the Master expects them, being intrigued by the first women who his son took interest in. Gwyn tries to talk her way out of it, and they start to make a scene, so the girls give up. The guards also grab Barbie, and HB leads Soft along there, too.

We're taken up and up, to a richly-decorated box among the noble boxes above the arena. It turns out the glass ceiling above the Pit looks like just a sand arena from this side, which means the nobles hadn't seen any of the bloodshed. 
Inside, in a rich chair, Julius Deepwater awaits us, with Servius at his side, holding a baby. 
HB walks Soft in, and then at Julius' behest, leads shell-shocked Servius out. 
Julius asks how we know Servius. We try to bullshit about it, but Julius doesn't buy any of it. He says he likes that his son has friends, but that he doesn't like that those friends get in the same trouble as Servius, even if his son is very persuasive about 'doing the right thing'. He tells us to keep our noses out of business that is not ours. 
Rowan's [[Trollbark necromantic barrier|cold feeling gets worse]] under Julius' gaze. 
We nod in response to his intimidation, and then Julius asks Soft to see us three out. He also gives Soft 10gp, as a reward for the right call of saving that baby, because it was useful to him. 


We discuss what to do, and Barbie goes looking for Servius in the backstage, but doesn't find him (but sees Orpheus). She doesn't notice her disguise falling off, and that makes drunk Hells' Bells drag himself over to proclaim that he knows a pink tiefling, who is pink _all over_ and who only fucks pink women, though not more than once. He notices Soft and tries to babble him into going upstairs for a quickie with him. Barbie attempts to talk him into taking her to the pink tiefling, who she assumes is Delirium.

Gwyn and Rowan are having a meltdown about how intense and evil Julius is. Rowan insists they stay to make sure their dad isn't there tonight. Rowan tries to get Gwyn to come home so they can discuss things. When Gwyn mentions she saw Orpheus around as a gladiator, and wants to sticks round to make sure he survives, but Rowan mentions that maybe it'd be better if he dies - if he works for Julius (he's here) and he knows their faces. In the end, she just warns Gwyn that Orpheus is not a good man and is very dangerous. 

Rowan de-disguises herself and gets herself into the noble boxes. She goes to the Amberseeker box, where she meets her father already there, with a young elf wizard that she recognizes as a magic student. She insights that this isn't, at least, a date. He introduces the youngster as [[Sylvan]]. Sylvan recognizes the tension and excuses himself out. 
Rowan starts tearing her father a new one about him "investing" in cards and the whole contract in regards of [[Amberseeker debts]]. She loses her shit when he suggests she could join the pit fights, since she's going to be a powerful wizard. 
Solomon admits the student is only there to keep him company, which is somehow worse than if he was his teenage lover. 
Rowan tries to talk some sense into her father, but his head is stuck up his ass. 
Eventually, she stays with him just to sniff out what else happens there. Sylvan actually attempts to flirt her up, and Rowan agrees to meet up sometime in the future to annoy her father. 

HB takes Soft out up to fresh air, while Barbie follows. She tries to convince him to lead her Delirium, and eventually he agrees to if Soft kisses him. Soft does, though not happy about it, and HB agrees to lead Barbie to Delirium's place. 
He leads them to a shared living place, to which he has a key, and knocks on a door and jiggles his bells (sort of like a password). 
Delirium opens, angrily. Barbie recognizes him, but his face is older, tired, _crueler_, his whimsy gone. There's only hatred in his eyes when he looks at Barbie. She tries to lovingly throw herself at his neck, and then we roll initiative.
