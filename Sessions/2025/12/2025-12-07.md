# Events

While Servius attempts to get whatever magic was hidden under his curse under control, the ink that melted off from him turns into a tiny inky creature and attacks us. 

It is resistant to fire and slashing damage. It is also vulnerable to radiant damage.
Orpheus figures out that it seems like a trap? That it's doing something. And that where it touched Gwynn and Misery's weapon, traces of its magic remain, marking them.
It seems to absorb water and grow with it, eventually wrecking Ori's tent with its size and crashing some of Ori's mystery potions on us. Gwynn is set on fire and her hair grows twice as long. Orpheus doesn't seem to be affected.
Misery manages to get it off Gwynn and it attacks her instead, and deals a LOT of acid damage. 
Eventually Orpheus finally joins the fight and one-shots it with radiant damage, and then the potion takes effect and he goes blind for a while. 
Soft manages to avoid the ink as the monster dies, and is the only one who isn't marked by the ink at the end. 

We find that what is ailing Servius is [[The Rot]], eating away at him, but another necromantic energy is trying to protect him and seems to be winning. He should be fine but it will be some time and it'll be painful. 
Once he comes out of it, he figures out he's un-cursed by being able to say "My name is Hadrian Deepwater, my father is Julius Deepwater, and I'm going to kill him."
When he hears about the [[Enchanter Drow]] vision, he immediately becomes scared and orders us to pack and that we need to leave.

Rowan spots the ink-magic-traces on us and tells us. Gwynn recognizes the traces as Divination with Detect Magic. 
We debate how to get rid of this, assuming it's going to track us. Eventually we get Soft and Orpheus to cast Create Water with Misery's holy water bottle to try to wash away the mark with rain. It succeeds, though the rain is black and oily thanks to Shar's involvement. Gwynn sees the [[Divination]] marks disappear, and the [[undeath stink|Necromancy]] on them flickers. It takes deeper hold on Rowan, but nothing happens to Hadrian or Orpheus as they pass Wisdom saves. 

We rush to pack anything useful and scram. On the way, Soft insists to grab Peep and Squeex. Squeex says they want to stay, as they're looking for their sister who is here somewhere, taken by the person who imprisoned them, too. 

Hadrian takes us underground, through the [[Spring Vale sewers]] and into tunnels that lead into the fucking Underdark. These tunnels should've been, according to history, destroyed after Spring Vale's war with the drow. They don't look re-opened, but actively used. 
He takes us to an elevator down, but as he tries to activate it, someone shoots a crossbow bolt at Soft. 
It turns out its Hells Bells and Delirium. HB keeps shooting at Soft, and Del is engaged with Orpheus and Soft. He ends up throwing a [[non-magical explosives]] at Orpheus and Soft and almost kills Soft. Orpheus gets angry and hits him back a lot. 
Hadrian finally gets the elevator to work and urges us in. Misery rolls her health potion towards Del, and apologizes for him being hurt, before getting on. Soft retreats, but Orpheus decides to continue pummeling Del. 
HB, having been ordered by Del, throws his own vial of explosives at everyone but Orpheus. Misery shrugs the fire off. Soft only stays upright thanks to being an Orc. Hadrian avoids the explosion, but Gwynn goes down. Hadrian stabilizes her.
Misery rushes off towards Orpheus, yelling at him to stop hurting Del, but Soft - with the help of Rowan's Portent - grabs her and drags her back to the elevator. 
Orpheus delivers a final blow to Del and retreats too. HB yells to Hadrian in thieves' cant, and he blanches, but takes us down, activating the elevator controls with his blood.

Orpheus heals us all on the way down. Misery is wailing and clawing at the elevator. Hadrian says to Soft that as the one who broke the curse, he is a priority one target for Julius. 

The elevator takes us to a little flowery meadow with a countryside cottage and an elderly woman in front of it. Hadrian takes off towards it.
