# Events

We argue about Orpheus killing Delight, and everyone is against Misery. They argument that he was attempting to kill them, so they couldn't show mercy, and Soft wouldn't leave without Misery. 
Eventually, since everyone is against her, Misery decided not to fight EVERYONE. Hadrian says we don't know for sure if Delirium is dead, and mentions that his [[Nana]] might know. He mentions the bubble is "a few weeks away from Spring Vale". Misery heads straight for the cottage. 
Rowan worries about her parents, and Hadrian says since they're nobles Deepwater may "just torture them a bit". She also reveals her unsigned Contract, and Hadrian says that Nana might have a solution to that too.

Misery asks Nana about Delirium's life immediately, and the woman tells her it can wait either way. 
The rest come in too. She keeps calling Julius "that useless man", and comments that Hadrian's friends are even weirder these days. She asks if any of us have a daughter. She recognizes [[undeath stink]] on Orpheus and Rowan, and asks where they got it. 

She invites us to stay for a while, but warns that her bubble can't be our home, and asks where we're headed. Hadrian asks us, and Misery starts dumping about the Rot and the necromantic barrier. Rowan questions her, because we can barely keep alive, let alone save the barrier. 
Nana offers us an answer to a question, or a boon, if we can decide what we need. 

Soft insights that she doesn't make deals that are fair, but deals that are fun. 

Rowan investigates the magic of the bubble, which seems weird and wrong. She notices that there's weird shit in the jars (like eyes), and poisonous herbs. She asks her for Nana's name, but gets no valid answer. 

Nana invites us to rest, and that we can talk about our needs and wants, including ones that we don't know about. She offers us food and rest, as Hadrian's friends, because she likes him even if he "didn't have the good sense to be born a daughter". Misery hesitates, because she doesn't think she is considered as "Hadrian's friends". 

Hadrian and the others attempt to convince Misery to reconsider being on Delirium's side, but she's not budging. Soft is the only one who understands her stubbornness, but Hadrian says he doesn't know shit about real life. 

After we eat, we wash off blood and the divine water-oil. Rowan investigates the bubble, and recognizes the magic as Fey, as from another Plane. 

Nana lets us set up for sleep and rest in the kitchen/living room. The next morning, she asks us again about our needs and wants. 

We decide to bargain as a group. We decide that we want to tackle the problem of the Rot, and are debating what to ask about.

Rowan settles on trading her "happiest memory" for knowledge on how to get out of the Contract with Deepwater. For her memory of her first, happy love, Rowan receives an ornate, gemstone-embedded skull that Nana says is "a memory for a future". The skull is a key to House of Mirth, house of [[Tyrias Leery]]. With that, Rowan can enter his home and destroy the contract, which will rid her of the problem. The entrance is located in Leery's office in Spring Vale, but to get the contract and destroy it will not be easy.  

Misery trades one of her [[Misery's horns|horns]] - cleaved through her bone at the base - for knowledge on how to disable the necromantic barrier. Nana says that to get thru, the easiest way would be with the help of the divine - to find a knife blessed by Selune (currently on a corpse of a Paladin in a crypt in the High Moor), which can be used to slice a tear in the barrier to go through it, and then will also help disable it from within.
Nana mentions that Misery also wanted to know if her brother is alive, and Misery immediately kneels back down offering the other horn. Nana tells her that he was killed, but he is alive. She does not elaborate when questioned about if he's alive, or undead. 

Nana hands the horns to Hadrian and everyone sort of panics what to do with them, and Gwynn and Soft try to re-attach them with Mending ?????? they fail, obviously, but Gwynn's Fey magic resonates with the Fey magic bubble and most of us realize that Nana is a hag. 

For the road, just because she likes Hadrian, Nana offers us travel rations and horses; the horses are kelpies, actually, young ones. They are Hadrian's friends, which makes them safe to ride for us for now.
Orpheus ops out and uses Find Steed instead.
