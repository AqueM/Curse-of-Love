# Events

It's raining in Spring Vale. 
Orpheus has a sad walk around the city, waiting for a proper time to go to the [[Deepwater Orphanage]]. 
When Soft and Barbie wake up, people are bitching about the weather, and worried about the broken [[bridge|Bridge sabotage]] impacting their jobs (no trade = no jobs). Soft also hears people whispering about trees they saw turning [[autumnal (rotten)|Trollbark Rot]] early. 

Barbie goes to her job at [[New Hope Orphanage]].
Soft goes to a shrine of Eldath again. He meditates and feels that something is trying to warn him about the trees and the water - some kind of impurity, imbalance. 

Gwyn wakes up in Oriana's place. She looks over the kids and notices that, though it's slower, they are dehydrating and malnourished etc. because the spell doesn't upkeep their body, just keeps them asleep. 
She tries casting Dispel Magic that she learned recently on the one that looks the worst. It works! The 6yo human wakes up. The [[carved spell sigil]] glows the same rotten green as the undead raven Soft tried to heal back then. 

The child is obviously afraid and suspicious, but is hungry enough to take food that Gwyn offers. When asked, the kid introduces himself as [[Trafficking Convoys|Andy]] or "number four" as he's called in The Orphanage. 
He remembers a fight that he lost, that he thought "they" would help but instead it probably resulted in the spell sigil. ([[Deepwater Orphanage|Pit Day?]])

Gwyn tries to wake up another child and also succeeds. Andy explains the situation to the kid. He's surprised to hear that Servius helped save them. The boy swears to kill Julius, but Andy convinces him to stay because "Servius told us to stay together and help each other, otherwise _he_ wins". The half-orc introduces himself as Gareth. 

When she wakes up, Oriana attributes the curse-lifting to lesbian sex. After some talking, Gareth asks if he could have more of the ointment to heal up the scar of the sigil, and Oriana says she'll sell a jar for 100 gold. Gwyn tries to haggle it down and fails. Gwyn only has 25gp, and pays it for one dose and applies it to Andy. His brand heals to smooth. 

Oriana tends her shop/lab and tells Gwyn to watch the kids while she waits for Servius to show up and figure out what to do with the kids. 
Gwyn remembers she has Sorcery Points and regains a spellslot, trying to dispel another sigil, but fails. 

Rowan spends the morning trying to find us with her familiar. She spots Orpheus. 
She also snoops in her father's study trying to find more info about his deal with Leery. She tries and fails to be sneaky about it. She also fails to find anything useful. But she does find something behind the family portrait - a magic circle on the wall holding something shut. She figures out that it's opened by her father's blood. She tries her own and it works. 
Behind it is a little hole in the wall with jewels and paperwork, including the loan-indentured servitude contract, and LOTS of debts, even more than Rowan or her mother suspected. She also inspects the jewels for magic using Detect Magic via a ritual, but is interrupted by the door opening. 
Her father walks in asks her WTF is she doing there. They argue about the contract/shady deals. He fully believes that her working for the [[Deepwater Orphanage]] would be nice and cool and sees nothing wrong with the contract. He considers that her working for them would be less weird and damaging for her than Gwyn's marriage for her. 
She stomps out angry, discreetly taking her contract with her. They have very awkward breakfast. 

Rowan goes to the Deepwater Orphanage, where she and Orpheus see each other and not acknowledge each other at all. 

Orpheus approaches the side-door he saw [[Flavia]] go through. He knocks, and someone at the other side barks a command at him from the other side, in a language he doesn't understand. He tries saying that he wants to apologize for yesterday and gets the same bark-command back. They continue this exchange for a while then he gets pepper-sprayed. 
He tries to break the door open and fails. He finally asks if it's easier to get someone to talk to by lurking in the alleys. Finally, someone talks to him and tries to shoo him away. Tells him to get lost and try the main gate if he doesn't know the password. 
Eventually Orpheus gives up and does go to the main entrance. 

Meanwhile, Rowan gets greeted by a homely halfling woman. She requests a meeting with Leery and the woman goes to ask Leery about it, because he usually doesn't meet people without appointments. 
She talks to him via some kind of stone magic telephone. Leery asks if she's here for trouble, and Rowan reinforces that she's on business here and wants a meeting NOW. She's lead inside through a decorated corridor, and the door to his office says his name and "Accountant". 
She tells him she wants to discuss the [[Amberseeker debts|deal]] between him and her father herself. She tells him that she won't follow this deal even if he signs it, and Leery says she's "part of his estate". Rowan argues it would be easier/more reliable to sign the contract with her directly. He replies that he prefers dealing with the head of the household, and also that he already is talking with him and doing business with her would be impolite.  
When she argues she would not be willing to work for them, he says "it would not be a problem to us" - Rowan figures out that he seems like either way he gets what he wants, if she works of if the loan hits the "deadline". 
He is not opposed to making a deal with her. She bets on them "seeking her father out for her talents specifically" to make a better deal, but he is not impressed and says she doesn't understand at all. 
Rowan tries casting Suggestion on him, and the spell fizzles out - he is immune to charming, which a tiefling is not. She figures out he must therefore not be a tiefling. 
He is offended by her casting spells and escorts her out of his office. 

Orpheus approaches the halfling lady and lies that he's here to adopt. He gets weird when she asks about his wife. The woman clocks him, and he admits he wants to meet her boss. 
She contacts her lady boss via the stone telephone. Orpheus doesn't provide her with any answers to her questions and eventually the boss agrees to see him but requests he leaves his "swords and enchanted weapons" in a locker.
He is escorted to a staircase downstairs. The 'office' has no door but has the ceiling painted to imitate the Underdark. Halfling Agness gets told off for allowing the weapon. 
He talks with the boss, who introduces herself as [[Prima]]. He wants to apologize for his altercation from yesterday and for his previous run-ins as a bounty hunter (?). 
He also wants to get hired, and through the conversation Prima comes to the conclusion he's an idiot. 
She asks him if he's looking for revenge, and he admits he's looking for a job more than for revenge, but she suggests both are possible. He says he can get in the Pit tonight as it's the Pit Day, and he can try to kill Flavia there because Prima has had enough of her causing trouble. If he survives he can get a job. 
She shoos him out, but doesn't make sur he leaves. 
On his way out he sees three people in hoods, and notices one of them is [[Servius]] who is in a lot of pain and pretends to not recognize him. Orpheus tries to follow him, but is SO LOUD sneaking around. 

As she walks out, Rowan tries to save her face, and Leery doesn't seem to hold her behavior against her. But he says he will keep his secrets, and maybe in a few decades they will be able to renegotiate. He says she would not enjoy "giving him what he wants" but that he will get it from his deal with her father, eventually. 
She decides to go to the temple of Tyr to try to get help deciphering her contract. 

Barbie goes along her day trying to find out more info about the pink tiefling/Delight.
The pink girl says the other pink tiefling is called [[Delirium]] but goes by Del. He comes to talk to chat with [[V]]. 
Barbie asks the other caretaker about places to check out and gets some recommendations. She seems to have a crush on a librarian (?).

Servius limps into Oriana's tent, gets a healing potion and some sexual harassment. He's still in a lot of pain. He talks with Gwyn and is very grateful about her waking up the kids. He tells that when the other two wake up, they're gonna run, and Gareth says he wants to fight. They argue about it. 
Servius tries to convince Gwyn to take the kids to another town, because he can't go with them until his father leaves town. He jokingly offers to marry her so she can get out of marrying the guy her parents chose for her, and so she can get him to her family doctor and heal him without raising too much suspicion. 

Rowan's familiar spots Gwyn, Servius and Barbie. 
Barbie runs into Servius, doesn't recognize Gwyn but rolls up to tell him about the owl following them. Gwyn recognizes the owl as Rowan's. 
They hide in an alley and discuss things, Barbie convinces Servius that Soft doesn't wish him ill. They doesn't exactly trust him/her to have Barbie lead Soft to Oriana, and Barbie says he shouldn't show up at a pub associated with his father, so Barbie pretends to take Soft out from his shift for a quickie and drags him to where Servius is hiding. 
Soft heals the boy, and in the process gets a feeling of just how much injuries he has. 
He says he has to go back for the Pit day. Gwyn finally tells Barbie who she is. 

Soft goes back to work. Barbie asks about Delirium and learns some. Gwyn tries to lose the owl. 
Barbie tries to convince Gwyn to tell her where she's staying. She manages not to, but follows Gwyn unnoticed, where she sees alchemical equipment.
