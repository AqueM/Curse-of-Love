# Events

Rowan, Barbie, Soft reach Spring Vale without any issues. It's not a docking day, so the streets are not too crazy. Rowan separates to "run errands" (get healed by A Guy She Knows) while Barbie and Soft think about accommodation. 

Rowan's Guy is [[Andreas]], magical-religious shopkeeper in temple district, owner of Feline Sun. She confesses she's touched something she shouldn't have, and he attempts to diagnose and remove a curse. She tells him she 'picked up' the curse in [[Trollbark Forest]] and about the [[Trollbark necromantic barrier]]. He eventually tell her he can't break it, partially because he doesn't wanna deal with the problems associated. He suggests to try the clergy or the university dean, as powerful as she can. 
Rowan intuits that he's honest, but he's not telling the entire truth. He does suggests that she should stop trying to investigate the source of her problem and tries to make sure the source did not follow her to town. He tells her the price for making him involve himself in this would be very high, and "for his cat's safety" bans Rowan from his shop because she "leaks necromantic energy".
As she leaves, he makes a note.

Soft and Barbie head to an [[First Fish|inn at the docks]]. The [[Tommy|bartender]] talks to them and says he would have job suggestions for both of them. They grab a drink. 
After some time a patron rolls up and the bartender refers to him as "boss". They have a pleasant conversation about kids and shit. It's a [[Julius Deepwater|middle-aged elf with dark hair]]. Barbie asks if perhaps the bartender could recommend her to his boss, and the elf suggests that a new orphanage for tieflings would be looking for a teacher. 
He then asks Soft if he's looking for a job, because he's _looking for extra hands_. He "confesses" he's having trouble with his teenager and needs someone to bring him back home before he "squanders his potential" by grabbing him at the city gate as someone who he doesn't recognize. 
Soft figures out that this man has at least one weapon on him, and it's scabbard looks more expensive than the entire establishment. Barbie is fucking blind. 
Soft offers to pick up the job for 200% its worth (4 silver). The elf offers 1g if Soft answers nor asks the kid any questions. He gives Soft directions back to his home, the orphanage up the hill, and a description of his son. Only then we realize he is referring to [[Hadrian Deepwater]] and thus must be [[Julius Deepwater]]. We both show that we recognize the kid by description. 
After Julius leaves, Soft goes to the gate to warn Servius, and Barbie tries to warn him not to cross Julius, then decides to go with him herself.

Gwynn re-dyes her hair to black for _discretion_. It is a successful disguise.
Squeex questions her plan to go back to Spring Vale but she tells him her plan is to just guide them and scram. 
We spot them entering the city, but don't recognize disguised Gwyn. 
Barbie tells Servius about them meeting Julius and he hands the horse to not-Gwyn and tells her a place to stash them where she also can hide from her parents. He goes with Soft willingly, and Barbie goes to the mentioned tiefling orphanage. 

Gwynn goes to the address, with Orpheus tailing his horse. It's a '[[Luck's Draw|Hippie District]]', with smoke and drugs and what not. She meets an [[Oriana|alchemist tiefling]]. She tells her Servius sent her and the alchemist agrees to help immediately. She questions Orpheus but he wants to get out of there so fast. 
Gwyn and Oriana talk about the [[carved spell sigil]] and she wants to test ways to heal/remove the effect. They test it on 'least liked kid'. The best effect is to heal the open wound of the carving, but not undo the spell. 
The tiefling, [[Oriana]] mentions to Orpheus that he 'stinks', presumably referencing the same 'undeath smell' as Andreas and the naiad. 
After Orpheus leaves, Oriana and Gwyn flirt and then have a fun time. 

Rowan goes [[Amberseeker Estate|home]], and it turns out her parents have a meeting with "Mr. [[Tyrias Leery|Leery]]" who Rowan doesn't know. She sneaks and spies on them. Lady Amberseeker is pissed at her husband. Her dad seems to be agreeable to accepting a loan from the guy. The agree to tell him if they accept by the end of the week, and if they don't, the offer would be detracted as it's their final offer. 
The guy is a tall red tiefling with a cane, looking like a noble. 

Rowan talks to her parents after Leery leaves. [[Lavinia Amberseeker|Lady Amberseeker]] thinks he is a criminal, while her husband argues that "his boss has an orphanage, he can't be bad". It turns out that they were offered a loan to help with their failing house finances. The terms are that Rowan would be employed by them until the loan is repaid, "no more than a century" according to [[Lord Amberseeker]]. Since this is Lord Amberseeker's idea, and Lady Amberseeker wants to fix finances with [[Gwynnestri|Gwyn]]'s marriage, both parents are apparently willing to 'sell' their daughter for money. 
Rowan is pissed and decides to have a sulky cry about it. 

Soft tries to talk Servius out of going home. A person dressed like a jester that Servius calls [[Hells' Bells]] sneaks up on them and speaks about the boy being in trouble with his dad. The jester sounds very horny and tries to invite Soft for a hookup. Soft declines and gets paid while Hells' Bells pulls Servius into the orphanage. 

Barbie approaches a caretaker at the [[New Hope Orphanage]] and asks if they can hire her or give her advice for staying in the city. She assures the caretaker that she's "normal about bards" because apparently there have been people who tried to get in because the orphanage is associated with the band [[Behind the Scenes]]. 
She's accepted and while getting a tour, a tiefling child approaches her. She's pink too, and she tells Barbie that there is a pink boy tiefling visiting them periodically and that he told her to give this [[flame-shaped hairclip]] if she meets another pink tiefling. Barbie recognizes it as [[Delirium]]'s possession and tells the kid to tell about her to the pink boy when he comes next time. She also learns that the boy has a job and that's why he doesn't visit too often.
She gets the job.
She goes back to the pub/inn and talks up a [[Tanguy|friendly guy for a meal]]. He doesn't believe her about  [[Stone|the troll under the bridge]]  though he knows about the bridge being busted. 

Rowan talks to her mom about the deal. She has a plan to come out of it on top, sort of: make the deal with [[Deepwater Employees]] herself, so she can be in control of the money and her employment (indentured servitude, basically). This way, she can also get close to Julius for intel. 
Lady Amberseeker says she can't broker the deal herself because her husband insists on proving himself, but she gives Rowan her blessing about her plan. 

Orpheus tries to bother someone else at the hippie place and runs into a blind seer, who instantly knows about his dead wife. He asks the seer if she can ask his wife who killed her, but his wife doesn't want to remember and just "is worried about him". 
He eventually goes to [[Deepwater Orphanage]] and it STINKS of bad vibes, but he can't tell what kind of. It also looks too nice, too perfect, the kids too happy etc. He hides in an alley and monitors the gate. He gets surprised by a young girl, putting a blade against a joint of his armor, questioning his motive. He can only see she's short with white hair before she tells him not to look. She threatens him further. 
He tries to get out of the danger zone and succeeds. He looks down at a [[Flavia|pale-skinned, white-haired human girl about 15yo]]. She calls the kids at the orphanage "friends". He tries to leave, and then she says she _recognizes him_. She lets him leave, giggling and saying he stinks, suggesting a rose perfume to cover it up ([[rose smell]]). That sets him off.  He demands answers, and she says "I think our message was pretty clear" suggesting there's an organized group behind it. 
He goes away but tracks her with Hunter's Mark, but loses her when she enters a building. 
He decides to go to one of his bounty hunter contacts to ask about the [[Deepwater Orphanage]]. He tells him that any info like that is out of his budget and above his paygrade, but it's a den of "people like you and me" and the best way to learn anything is to make friends with them, like by working for them or having a contact. He decides to just go to the Orphanage via the front door next day.
