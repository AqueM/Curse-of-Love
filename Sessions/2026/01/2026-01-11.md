# Events

We approach [[Secomber]]. There is a blockade at the gate, with clergy testing everyone before they're allowed in. 
Soft figures out they're Selunites, and that the magic circle tests not only people, but also cargo etc. We think it's a protection from the Rot.

Soft and Gwyn approach them, as we think Rowan and Orpheus won't pass due to undeath stink, and Hadrian because of his Necromancy vibe. 
They don't get much info from the clergy, but they do pass the test and get inside. They get a skin-stamp of a crescent moon, marking them to be able to trade in the city. The guard confirms that this is all against "a sickness" and that the temple of Selune will be able to provide information and protection charms. 
The guard tells them that the system is because of "an incident" before, despite it all costing a lot of money and time. 

The rest of the party is accosted by a border collie. It tries to drag Rowan away by the skirt, and everyone is freaking out. We almost let Orpheus kill it, but Misery ultimately manages to cast Suggestion and make it go away. 
We find a place to camp, but the atmosphere is atrocious due to who is there (and we also decide to reunite present party members), so Misery goes to try to get into the city. 

Gwyn and Soft go to the Selune temple and ask a priestess - Kora of Selune - about 'the incident'. She tells them some pigs have eaten contaminated grain and turned "unpleasant to deal with and hard to kill" (zombies?). They became "indiscriminately hungry" (eating each other, people, passing animals...), and wouldn't settled down until they were "sliced into pieces and burned down". 
They also had one person who ate contaminated pork and suffered similar symptoms. They hadn't found any cure yet, but are hard at work, hoping for Selune's help. 
She also tells us that the "protection charms" aren't real, just some merchants' scams. She offers some actual Selunite charms that, though not directly protective against [[The Rot]], "can't hurt". 

Misery attempts to go through the gate, but the magical circle react to the [[iron mask]] in her bag, making it glow blood-red. It's confiscated, wrapped in silk and locked away. She gets a dot on her crescent moon tattoo, marking her as having "one strike" against the city. Two will get her banished, third one - executed. 
She finds Gwyn and Soft, but doesn't tell them about this incident. 

We find a bladesmith who would take a half-orc as an apprentice pretty quickly in the craft/industry section of the city. This bladesmith has no signs of Selune, not having had bought into the religious craze. 
The shopkeeper asks what they're there for, and Misery tells her that she wants to see Yuta and that Yoko sent her. He is surprised to find it's not a sibling. They agree to meet later, after workday, at the Iron Ship inn to talk his help over. We are supposed to ask Thomas, the owner, to be put on the first floor for privacy. He also asks if Gwyn is going to stay around for a while _wink wink_. 
The shopkeep is worried about size difference between them. 

We make our way back to the potioneer. He gave us 50gp and a gem for sale to cover supplies.
Our shopping list is:
- food
- waterproof shoes
- climbing gear?
- camping gear
- ~~expensive book for Misery (25gp)~~
- poisons for Hadrian (or empty bottles if not possible to get poisons)
- maps of the Hight Moor
We manage to find all we need, except the book. Misery browses the books to find what she would want, but she can't afford it nor is feeling like she can succeed in stealing - tries to at least, but the guard doesn't let them in because they don't look wealthy/educated enough. 

At dinnertime we go to Iron Ship. The barkeep thinks Soft is the "leader". When we speak of the first floor meeting, he says he didn't think Yuta knew "fine people like you" meaning Misery and Gwyn. 
There is a pool table and a few sitting tables upstairs with candles, all with the vibe of Shady Backroom for Shady Deals, contrasting with the ground floor that is lively. Yuta shows up soon.

He suggests that since we never faced a monster, we should join a caravan. He lists types like monster hunters, treasure hunters/archeologists, scavengers. 
We tell him we're looking to go into a ruined temple of a "darkness deity", so perhaps a treasure hunter? He is not convinced that we're impressive enough to get with a good caravan. 

He says he'll figure it out, and that he'll contact us when he found us a job. Gwyn stays with him for a fuck and as our contact while Misery and Soft return to the party camping outside. 
Hadrian and Misery drink their sadness away about it. 

Misery tells Hadrian and Rowan about the iron mask incident. We figure out it's probably the key they used to enter the Rot barrier, but we don't know if it'd be dangerous to use it and/or if it's still got it after it got to Selunites. We consider stealing it back, but decide against it for the time being. 
Hadrian goes out to steal a book for Misery, mostly because the shop was rude and classist to her. He also comes back some day dirty and says he "made friends", probably in low/shady places.

Gwyn makes bank at an inn giving a comedy show. She garners some fame, especially as a friend of Yuta. 

Hadrian comes back with two books in a bag, warning that one of them _bites_. The other doesn't seem to like natural light, and doesn't want to be opened. 
The biting book is not impressed by hissing back from Misery, but it does calm down when Hadrian scritches it, purring. Misery can't get close, so we decide the that one stays with Hadrian, who treats it like a pet cat (he theorizes this book is actually a stray cat turned into a book).
The other book smells like old decaying meat to everyone except Hadrian, who says it smells good but blushes and refuses to elaborate what it smells like. 

Hadrian says we shouldn't go near the bookshop because he "left a present" there that made that street unsafe. It would be set off by the shopkeeps, probably. Eventually he admits he just let loose some of the more dangerous books. He is 'shy' about it because he beat up the (some?) shopkeepers and left them to the mercy of the books. 
We talk about the morality of that action. He hopes the guards will find them and investigated and raided. 

Hadrian shares some backstory about why his father doesn't want him to be a bard (bards are essentially prostitutes according to Julius, and "nobody under his name will be a prostitute ever again").
