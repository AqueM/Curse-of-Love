# Events

We're dropped along the river Delimbyr and try to ascertain which way to go. Eventually, we decide to go upstream towards Secomber. It is very cold, so we're worried about freezing, and the kelpies fuck off back to the Bubble too. 
We go along the river and eventually Hadrian spots smoke deeper into the forest. We go there and find a village. The smoke appears to come from a funeral pyre.
We present ourselves as a group of adventurers. Everyone in the village is an orc. 

As we pay respects to the pyre, a woman approaches us. She asks if we knew her sister, and Soft admits that no, but it would be rude not to acknowledge the dead. She appreciates that and invites us to the wake. Introduces herself as Dina. There is also a woman with a baby in the house, who she approaches. The entire village is supportive, and not paying much attention to us despite being very colorful. 
Only a kid approaches us, trying to act big and protective about the village. He introduces himself as Taro. He questions us a bit who we are and why, and Misery butchers a Deception roll, and eventually Taro ends up inspecting us because of our lack of tusks etc. His father comes to scold him and sends him outside to his brother because "we don't have time today for that".
He is the leader of the village and invites us to talk someplace else. We leave with him. 

We stop just outside. He introduces himself as Yoko. He says the dead woman died in childbirth. He offers us to stay the night in his house, though he doesn't have spare beds or rooms. He says that Dina probably will open the shop tomorrow where we will be able to buy gear, if anything (not today, due to the funeral). 

While out and about, we look into the situation a bit closer but it seems like a normal death, no magic or Rot influence.

Yoko says they don't have "a quest" for us, but that they could always use magical mending. 

Hadrian goes out to brood about childbirth death, and also to check where the father is. Gwyn follows. After some sneaking about, he doesn't find anyone that looks like the father. He even checks if the pyre has two bodies, worried that all men are shitty fathers. 

Gwyn wants to ask around/eavesdrop at the wake, Hadrian tries to talk her out of it and succeeds.

Meanwhile, Rowan wants to investigate her ornate skull. She uses Detect Magic and rolls Arcana, but can't tell much. It's [[Transmutation]] magic, and briefly feels like something - someone? - is looking back at her from the skull's eyeholes. Rowan insights that it has the potential to be very helpful or very harmful, but she doesn't know how to make it one or the other. 

While waiting for Yoko and his family to come home, Misery cleans up the house a bit as thank-you for the hospitality. 
They give us food from the wake. Misery asks if Dina and her family and the other parent of the kid are okay. Yoko says her older sister, Mary, will be nursing the child as she just had her own recently. He avoids answering about the other parent. 
Rowan stealthily casts Detect Thoughts to figure out why. His surface thoughts are about the father leaving, and he worries - can't decide if they should try to ask us to find him? They can't afford adventurers. 
Rowan offers our help in exchange for winter clothing, and Yoko says he needs to discuss it with Dina. 

He comes back from that discussion stealthily angry. He tells us that Dina, the dead mother's twin, is willing to do the exchange for finding her brother-in-law. 
The man is missing since a moment after the mother was pronounced dead. His name is Ashi. He is one of the oldest members of the village, moved in some 20 years ago. He used to be a warrior, now a hunter. 
He took his hunting gear and left. Nobody saw him leave, though. Dina thinks he left and he's a waste of time, Yoko is suspicious that it may be something weird happening. 
The pregnancy was normally healthy, they seemed a happy marriage, and he wasn't a loner, even if he wasn't the most social. 
There are more wolves than usual around, which is the only thing that could challenge his skills as a hunter. 
Nothing out of ordinary was happening lately to pregnancies in the village, but this childbirth was terrible - "everything that could go wrong, went wrong". 

We decide to do our first investigations tonight, not to miss any traces. 
We warm Hadrian up and cast Fly, so he can scout from above. The rest of us go to Ashi's house - which is mostly empty now, though some people remain after the wake. 
We investigate the outside of the house. There are no obvious traces (except Hadrian climbing up the walls). A hunting knife has been left intentionally in a woodcutting stump. 
Hadrian didn't see a fire, but he saw someone climbing up a hill about a half day away (a day for us). We ask Yoko about it. He's upset about it. He assumes Ashi went there to dig his own grave, next to his brother's grave. Ashi never visited it before, but was clear that's where he wants to be buried. 
Yoko says they'll go fetch the bastard's corpse when it thaws in spring. His wife tries to reassure him, and convince him he too would not be thinking straight. Yoko disagrees, but his wife urges us to try to save Ashi. 

In the morning, we try to figure out a suitable beast to help us travel up the hill. We choose a young white dragon, and Polymorph Soft and Hadrian. Everyone is very excited about this. Hadrian carries Gwyn and Misery, and they do good with holding on. Orpheus and Rowan ride Soft, and Orpheus kind of falls off. He gets grabbed luckily.
We approach the climbing orc and *intimidate* him as hello. He is startled and falls off, fully passing out. Hadrian whiffs catching him. Soft does manage to carry him, after some magical help from Silvery Barbs.

We carry him back to the village. Ashi is taken inside to warm up. Hadrian leaves, letting us deal with Ashi. 
Rowan attempts to talk to him. 
We end up intimidating him and being mean and yelling at him about duty and children. He admits to being a coward and not knowing how to live without his wife. Misery manages to convince him that love is more important, and they he can lean on others who hurt like him. 

He is convinced by Yoko's wife to go see his newborn daughter, and Yoko is thankful. He says we will henceforth have friends in the village.
Hadrian comes back at the end of the day, drunk and emo. Misery sits with him in silence. 

We get directions to Secomber and, in a few days, winter clothes from Dina. 
We also learn that the High Moors has been *infested* with monsters up until recently (the evil magics are slowly fading), though it still is very very bad and wild. They don't know about any Selune temples, but they do know about a castle? We may be able to join a caravan in Secomber that knows the land better.
